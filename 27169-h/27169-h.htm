<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Some fifteen years ago, when the first
mention was made in the Imperial Parliament
of the intention of Her Majesty to dismember
the Northern districts of New South Wales,
for the purpose of establishing a refuge for the
expatriated felons of Great Britain, a certain
noble lord rose to enquire where New South
Wales was, and whether it was anywhere in
the vicinity of Botany Bay.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>Since the time of this sapient patrician
much has been said, and more has been
written, respecting our antipodean empire;
though I believe the mass of the English
people are still as unacquainted with the
characteristics of the colony, and the manners
of colonial life, as if the vast continent of
Australia remained in its primitive inanition.
Poor as is the knowledge of our friends "at
home" respecting their periecian brethren, I
grieve to say, with regard to, or rather of,
the Australian colonists, that knowledge is
too frequently tinged with prejudice and
erroneous impressions, formed from the writings
of discontented colonists, who, without
a sufficiently lengthened residence in the
country, or opportunities to form correct
opinions, have not only disregarded facts,
but have presumed to pass judgment upon
what they have never appreciated or under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>stood,
and have written statements decidedly
false and scandalous.</p>

<p>It is notorious that in some circles of
society, the bare mention of Australia in connexion
with any one's name is sufficient to
create a feeling of distrust and contempt, and
the colonists are at once stamped as being,
at least, something mean, with antecedents
involved in a suspicious obscurity. Unfortunately
there have been writers, too, who
have come before the public professing an
intimate acquaintance with, and an impartial
judgment of, colonial life, who have not failed
to heap aspersions on the very name of the
country and everything connected with it,
and to envenom their writings with the
rankest untruths. I have read accounts of
colonial society where it has been characterized
as the vilest that can be imagined in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
a civilized state; where the men are spoken
of as habitual debauchees, and the women
as universally shameless, immoral, and dissipated;
where life and property are insecure;
and bushrangers are the terror of
the inhabitants.</p>

<p>I don't say such productions are numerous.
I rejoice that they are not; but many people
are inclined to receive such a description as a
truthful one, and to consider a true narration
of facts as merely an over-drawn and flattering
panegyric of an interested author. People
have been long accustomed to look upon
Australia as only a place for convicts, and
the population, if not prisoners themselves
or those who have served their allotted term,
at least as the descendants of those who have
done so. I have frequently had the question
gravely put to me whether or not such is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
case; and have experienced great difficulty
in inducing people to believe otherwise.
They forget, if indeed they ever knew, that
many leading men in this country owe their
position in society to a prosperous career in
the Australian colonies, and that more than
half the colonial settlers are men of good
family connexions who have emigrated to
improve their position in occupations which
are at the same time remunerative and
honourable.</p>

<p>When this is remembered, in conjunction
with the fact that transportation has been
discontinued for many years, and that, after
the expiration of a convict's term of expatriation,
if of an incorrigible nature, he
invariably returned to the "old country,"
where he had a wider field for the exercise
of his genius, it can't but be seen that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
generally, there must be a healthier tone of
society in the colony than is credited "at
home;" while morality is quite on a par,
if not above the ordinary level of British
ethics. At the same time it is only but
just to state that the greater proportion of
what vice does exist is chargeable to that
wild and uncontrollable mass, which, generally
attracted to gold-producing countries,
necessarily forms there the substratum of
the working population; while the native
born portion of the people is entitled to all
praise for its strict propriety. To remove
this stigma of <i>mauvais ton</i>, and establish
our fair name in opposition to the mal-impressions
which have gained currency
respecting the Australian colonists, I have
been induced to add another to the tales
of Australian life, and to lay "Fern Vale"
before the public.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>I don't enter the arena so much to defend
the colonies collectively, as to present a fair
face for the young one of Queensland, and to
draw attention to it as a field for British
labour, industry, and capital. And being
disposed to think this description of work
will find more favour in the eyes of that class
I would especially desire to attract, than a
topographical and statistical treatise, I have
blended facts with fiction to present my
volume to the public in such a form as to
afford amusement with information. I have
endeavoured to depict life and manners as
they exist in Queensland, and to describe the
country, its climate, and capabilities. The
leading political topics of the day I have also
lightly touched upon; but, while craving the
indulgence of the public in these interpolations,
I may remark I have only treated
them to a very cursory glance; considering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
that, in the present mutable state of legislation
in Queensland, to enter more fully into
detail would be inadvisable. The colony is
young, but the government is infantine;
though, notwithstanding that it is little
more than two years old, it has proved itself
indefatigable, concise, and beneficial in its
workings; and many a local incubus has
been removed, and many a long felt desideratum
been supplied, during its short period
of existence.</p>

<p>To illustrate what the district was, and
what it had to labour under, I have drawn
all my characters as existing under the
<i>regime</i> prior to the felicitous epoch of "separation."
But to prevent my readers from
forming an erroneous impression of our
model colony, I will succinctly furnish a
synopsis of our march of improvement.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>The old iniquitous land system has been
abolished; and in its place one substituted
similar to what I have mentioned in this
work as being the scheme of Dr. Lang.
One of the first acts of the new government
was to sweep away the trite and
cumbersome machinery of the old system,
by making nugatory the existing law of
the parent colony, and to pass an act
which, for liberality, perhaps stands unequalled.
Its main features are&mdash;for pastoral
purposes&mdash;occupation and settlement,
with right of tenure, subject to a rental of
one farthing per acre per annum; and for
agricultural lands&mdash;free selection for purchase
at the fixed rate of one pound per
acre, with a right to rent in contiguity
thrice the quantity purchased for a period
of five years at a yearly rental of sixpence
per acre, with the option of purchase at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
expiration of the lease, at the residue of
the purchase money, viz., 17s. 6d. per acre.
To all immigrants paying their own passage,
a remission of their passage money
is granted in an equivalent of land. This,
with the activity of the government in
throwing large tracts of land into the market,
has done away with a good many of
the abuses detailed in our narrative; more
especially the "station jobbing," attributed
to Bob Smithers, and the vexatious detentions
to small capitalists desirous of becoming
farmers. Another of its features is the
inducement held out to the agriculturalist
to cultivate cotton in the shape of bounties
almost amounting to the value of the staple.
The towns have also been benefited by the
establishment of municipalities which have
removed many long standing nuisances.
The old forensic injustice, and judicial bur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>lesques,
have been annihilated by the
appointment of district police magistrates;
and, in fact, the whole country and people
have "gone a head."</p>

<p>With regard to the incidents of my story
I may say that, almost without an exception,
they are facts well known to Moreton Bay
people; and, though I have used some discrimination
in their collocation, so as to a
certain extent to shield the actual actors
from the public gaze, I have in no way
exceeded the margin of truth. The scene
at the "Bullock's Head," I must guard
against any charge of plagiarism by stating,
is the description of an actual occurrence
which took place not many years ago in
the town of Brisbane, and, if I mistake not,
the principal actor in which is still living,
and in this country. Captain Jones' mar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>riage,
its results, the poisoning, murder, and
protection society, are all drawn from life;
though, as I've said before, varied in their
arrangement. Neither have I indulged in
any flights of the imagination in depicting
the horrible, but rather subdued the poignancy
of the original; particularly in the
case of the murder, which in my hands has
received considerable detrition. Though the
proceedings of "the society" may be said to
be the "coinage of my brain," I have not
hazarded such an accusation, as is contained
in their narration, without being possessed of
sufficiently authentic information to warrant
me in doing so. After the melancholy event,
from which I borrowed the idea of the Strawberry
Hill massacre, it is known for a fact
that the blacks mysteriously disappeared from
the country; while the squatters were out in
arms for weeks scouring the bush, and made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
no secret of their enrollment for a mutual
protection. At the same time I have heard a
settler of the district, and one of considerable
means and standing, when alcohol had stimulated
his nerves and courage, boast that
he had shot <i>hundreds</i> of blacks; and have
also heard others speak of such an action
as merely an unpleasant necessity. I must
caution my readers, however, from imagining
that, because the tragical event which
immediately precedes the <i>denoument</i> of
my plot occupies so conspicuous a place in
the narrative, such dangers are incidental
to a residence in the bush. Far from it.
Security reigns supreme; and I merely engrafted
the too well known catastrophe to
my compilation to add interest to the tale.
Such visitations are, happily, not to be heard
of once in a generation, and then only on
the extreme borders of civilisation. Convicts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
are no longer noticeable, and bushrangers
are only known as myths or scourges of
historical notoriety.</p>

<p>The peculiar idiom of the blacks, in their
conversation with the settler, I have introduced
to give some idea of the unintelligible
and periphrastic jargon the whites have to
adopt to make themselves understood. And
so accustomed do the squatters, and their
men, become in its use that they naturally
fall into it whenever they experience any
difficulty in making themselves understood
by any one not acquainted with their language.
Hence all foreigners, of whom, especially
Germans and Chinese, there are a
great many in the colony, who have not a
thorough knowledge of the English tongue
when they come to the country, acquire this
peculiar phraseology.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>I fear I must crave the pardon of many of
my friends for having introduced into my
book some little episodes in their personal
history which they may not have desired to
have had laid before the world. But, though
such may be recognisable to themselves, I feel
safe in expressing my confidence that to the
public they will remain hid by the veil of
fiction.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Kate, I can't help leaving you
at least for a time; and if we can make any
settlement with Smithers for any of his
country, you know I'll soon be back for you:
so don't make me disheartened by seeing you
so melancholy. John has started some time
since with the pack-horses, and seeing you
had run away from the parlour while the
governor was talking to me, I have followed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
you to see you look cheerful, and get another
kiss before we part. My mother thinks me
already on the road, and Joey is only
strapping on my valise to the saddle."</p>

<p>"I shall be so lonely, Will, when you are
gone; I'll have no one to ride with, and as for
kangaroos, I am sure I shall not see one until
you return, for you know Papa never cares
about going out with the dogs. You may as
well take the poor things with you, for they
will be of no use here; they will be company
and afford amusement to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind them, Kitty, I'm for work
not sport; but come now dry up your tears,
and while I am away be sure and make yourself
a proficient in housekeeping, because you
know, if we succeed in forming a station, as
soon as we can get up a decent sort of a
<a name="humpie" id="humpie"></a><ins title="original had no open quotation mark">'humpie,'</ins> and comfortably settled, I will come
and fetch you; and know thou, my Kitty
darling, if you do not make your brothers as
contented as they in their gracious will shall
desire, they will publish throughout the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
length and breadth of the land the short-comings
of their pert little sister; and the
decree once gone forth that our Kitty is a
useless little baggage, and not fit to be a
squatter's wife, what will she do then?"</p>

<p>"She will tell her brothers' friends that she
is the persecuted victim of a pair of ungrateful
fellows, who are never satisfied with anything
that is done for them, and I know which
of us they will believe. But, Willie, Mr.
Wigton tells us the blacks are very troublesome
down where you are going: will there
be any danger in living there?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest, my dear: it is all nonsense
the way in which croakers talk about
the blacks. Some of our imperious settlers, by
their own conduct, encourage them to commit
depredations and to revenge wrongs; but, for
my part, I never knew a black fellow make an
unprovoked aggression, whereas Mr. Wigton
merely speaks from what he has been told by
the squatters."</p>

<p>"Well, but, Willie, you say the country is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
quite unoccupied: will not the natives be
dreadfully wild, and easily provoked to
commit some horrible act? Would it not be
better to avoid any risk, by getting a station
in some more settled part of the country?"</p>

<p>"Believe me, my pet, your fears are perfectly
groundless; I have had more experience
with the blacks than most people, and I have
no unpleasant apprehensions from our squattage.
However, our speculations are all in
precedence of our plans, and your objections
are only advanced on conjecture; it will be
quite time for you to disparage our home
when we have formed one, and I can assure
you, my dear Kate, neither John nor I would
wish you to leave the security of our parents'
roof for our protection, if by so doing you
would imperil your precious little self. But,
even if there were any danger to us, to you,
I believe, there would be none; unless indeed
it were to be carried off by some bold, adventurous,
and enthusiastic son of the soil to
receive the homage of his illustrious country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>men
as their tutelary angel. But to prevent
any such predatory outrage, we will form
ourselves into a body-guard and enlist the
services of all the knights-errant of the neighbourhood."</p>

<p>"You are an impudent fellow, and I have
a good mind to give at once my refusal to
go; but if you do settle there, I hope you
will cultivate the acquaintance of some nice
people, if there are any near you."</p>

<p>"Nice gentlemen you mean, I know. Oh,
yes! I will try and oblige you on that point;
but good-bye, Kate, I must be off."</p>

<p>With this remark concluded the colloquy of
William Ferguson and his sister, Kate; and
after a mutual embrace, the young man
bounded from the room, and in a few minutes
might have been seen riding through the bush
at a sharp canter, in company with his black
boy, Joey, to overtake his brother on the road,
who, as the reader has already learnt, left the
house some time previously with the pack-horses,
laden with the provisions and necessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
articles requisite for their journey. While we
leave the young men to proceed on their way,
and their sister sitting listlessly gazing with
tearful eyes through the open window of the
drawing-room, conjuring in her imagination
the scenes through which her brothers were
about to pass, we will cursorily glance at the
family whose acquaintance we have just
made.</p>

<p>Mr. Ferguson, the elder, the proprietor of
Acacia creek, where we find ourselves for the
<i>nonce</i> located, was a gentleman who had
attained the meridian of life, though years sat
lightly on his open brow. He was tall and
handsome, robust in constitution, affable,
benign, and hospitable in disposition; a fond
father, and one of the most respected settlers
in the district of which he was a magistrate.
As his history is somewhat romantic, the
reader may be disposed to pardon the digression,
in our stopping here to give a brief
outline of it.</p>

<p>John Ferguson, who was a native of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
Scotland, and a member of an ancient family
who prided itself on its blood and lineage
more than on its virtues and frugality, was
early left to battle with the world through the
prodigality of a parent, whose greatest pleasure
was to keep the most hospitable board in his
county, and whose greatest dread was to be
stigmatised with (what was to him the <i>acme</i>
of derogation) meanness and parsimony.
Though the family, through the extravagance
of its head, was reduced to extreme penury,
it was with the utmost difficulty the pride
and prejudices of the father could be overcome,
to be induced to allow his son to accept
an appointment in a government office in
London, which had been obtained through the
intervention of a well-wisher of the family,
and offered to the young man.</p>

<p>The course of life, which the acceptance
of this situation would open to the fancy of
young Ferguson, was congenial to his ardent
imagination and enthusiastic spirit. He
therefore joyfully accepted the post, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
was kindly and delicately offered as a means
of employment and support to himself and of
pecuniary relief to his parents, as a stepping-stone
to fortune; while the romance with
which his disposition was tinged, served to
picture to his prophetic vision, scenes of
official gradation and pre-eminence. How
often do young men of similar temperament
indulge in the same enticing speculations, and
allow themselves to be carried away by the
blissful creations of a fertile fancy; alas!
only to awake from the intoxication of their
delightful dream, to realize the pangs of a
bitter disappointment, and a total dispersion
of all their brightest hopes. Not that we
deprecate the indulgence of such romantic
feelings. We believe it frequently produces
that emulation, by which a persevering and
indomitable spirit is frequently enabled to
realize the dreams of the bright imaginative
fertility of youthful ardency; but, as we shall
presently see it was in the case of young
Ferguson, so it is too often in general life,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
that such visions are doomed to speedy dissipation.</p>

<p>In due time the young man entered
upon the duties of his office with a zeal
commensurate to the exalted nature of
his expectancy; but the ideal varnish of his
mental conception speedily vanished under
the hard brushing of a monotonous official
routine, and his romance succumbed to the
realities of a mundane experience. Though
the appointment, to which our young friend
had been inducted, was all that could have
been desired for the scion of a noble house,
whose pampered whims and vices were to be
ministered to by the lavish hand of a fond
parent, and where the display of mental
abilities was no more necessary than in
the propulsion of the mechanism of one of
Her Majesty's establishments erected for the
ambulating exercises of petty delinquents, yet
to a young and high-spirited nature, such as
John Ferguson's, the very absence of any
intellectual requirements in the performance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of the duties devolving upon him, caused him
soon to feel a distaste for the service; while
the indolence and self-importance practised
and assumed by his colleagues (and so much
emulated by the class of candidates for such
honours) were to him extremely irksome and
disagreeable, and early caused his energetic
disposition to be dissatisfied with his position.</p>

<p>He had been some little time in his office,
and began to experience the feelings which we
have described, when, through the instrumentality
of the kind friend to whom he
was indebted for his appointment, he began to
circulate in that society which by his family
connexions he was entitled to mix in. To
say he was not fascinated with the polish,
gaieties, and pleasures of a fashionable town
life, would be to conceal the truth: though, at
the same time, we must say their hollowness
soon became apparent to his mind; and he,
instead of following the example of most men
in similar circumstances, and making himself
the slave to the pleasures and dissipations of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the fashionable world, looked calmly on the
allurements of society, and preserved a perfect
control over his mind and morals. During
the vortex of a London season, he added to
the list of his friends a merchant of considerable
standing, and of very large reputed
wealth. In the house of this gentleman, who
was pleased with the young man's sterling
qualities, apparent to the quick perception of
the man of business, he received a <i>carte
blanche</i>; and thence commenced the intimacy
which formed the romance of his life.</p>

<p>Mr. Williamson, the gentleman of whom
we have spoken, had an only daughter, the
mistress of his house, and the idol of his
heart and of all who knew her. She was
beautiful in the extreme. Her disposition
was of the sweetest description, and fully
justified the lavishment of the fond parental
affection with which she was blessed; while
her amiability was only equalled by her
dutiful attention and consideration of the
smallest wish of her kind and doating parent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
That such a being should arrest the notice of
a young man of the temperament of John
Ferguson is not to be wondered at, nor that his
attention was rivetted on her the first moment
his eyes were gladdened with the seraphic
vision. The first feeling of admiration soon
gave place to a sentiment of a warmer kind,
and it was not long ere young Ferguson was
hopelessly entangled in the meshes of Cupid's
net, deeply immersed in the sea of love;
which, for his ardent nature, was of that
turbulent kind that knew no control, nor
experienced any pleasure, except in the society
of his fair enslaver. This feeling was long kept
a secret within his own bosom, and his time
glided happily by in the sweet countenance
of this charming creature, content in the
privilege of loving, and fearful lest a disclosure
of his sentiment should break the
spell.</p>

<p>Love is a strange emotion; its inexplicable
workings operate with an occult influence,
irresistible and unaccountable; and while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
our hearts receive a glow and pleasure at the
mere contemplation of the object of our love,
our selfish gratification blinds us to all but
our <a name="own" id="own"></a><ins title="original had on">own</ins> extatic delight, and eliminates from
our minds all considerations not directly
tending to a consummation of our desires.
At the same time our cowardice often
operates on our fancies so as to create fears,
lest to the object of whom we are enamoured
we prove indifferent, and we fancy ourselves
almost criminal for loving. Though possibly
not a common phase in the <i>esprit d'amour</i>, it
was, nevertheless, the one in which burnt the
lamp of our friend; for though he loved Miss
Kate Williamson to distraction, he never
ventured to breathe one word to her that was
likely to disclose the fire that consumed his
heart. 'Tis true her manner to him, though
cordial in the extreme, was not such as to
inspire him with the idea that his love was
reciprocated. With the high sense of her
filial duty, she conceived herself bound to
receive the authorized attentions of a gentle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>man
possessing the warrant of her father's
friendship, and, in return for that friend's
civilities, to tender those little captivating
mannerisms, and throw into her receptions
and interviews those sweet and winning ways,
so peculiar to beings of her stamp. Beyond
that, however, she gave him no encouragement.
It may be she soon perceived, what
John Ferguson failed to conceal, the pleasure
which he enjoyed while in her society; it
may also be that those visits, which she at
first considered a duty to her parent to
receive, she afterwards welcomed with receptions
as warm and cordial as possible,
compatible with her own modesty; and it
may be true that she began to admire their
visitor for his own merits, and reciprocate
pleasure in their numerous interviews, while
she little dreamt, that what she considered
the mere acts of hospitality, were making
such havoc in the breast of John Ferguson.
He, on the other hand, while admiring the
bright object ever in his mind, feared ven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>turing
a disclosure, which, in his position and
prospects, his conscience whispered to him
would be considered presumptuous. Thus
matters rested, until a fortuitous circumstance
broke the spell that bound these two young
hearts, and disclosed to each the transitory
nature of their dream.</p>

<p>A young physician of considerable practice,
good connexions, gentlemanly manners, and
prepossessing appearance, and who had long
been known to and intimate with the family,
in an interview with Mr. Williamson, declared
his admiration for his daughter's virtues, and
expressed an esteem for herself, that justified
the father in sanctioning his request to be
admitted as an acknowledged suitor for the
young lady's hand; and his pretensions to
her regards were supported by her father,
who believed their congeniality of tempers
would render such an alliance happy and
prosperous.</p>

<p>Miss Williamson listened to the appeals
of her admirer, we must admit, with satis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>faction;
and though his addresses were not
distasteful, she felt a pang in her heart that
plainly told her it was already possessed by
another. It required but this spark to kindle
the flame that had long been smoldering in her
breast; and at the moment when, had she not
known John Ferguson, she would have been
pleased and flattered with the protestations of
her suitor, she felt disappointed and distressed
that those proposals had not emanated from
another source. The very contemplation of
this disappointment increased the warmth and
ardour of her affection for young Ferguson,
while it annihilated all thoughts of the other;
and even, respecting as she did the wishes of
her father, she could offer no encouragement
to his medical friend. The young son of Galen,
unacquainted as he was with the real state of
the lady's feelings, attributed her taciturn abstraction
to the innate modesty of her nature,
and therefore delicately refrained from pressing
proposals which he perceived she was not
prepared to entertain. Contemplating the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
resumption of the subject at a future time,
when the lady's mind would have in all
probability recovered the shock, which he
imagined was occasioned by the novelty of
her situation, he left her, while he expressed
the deepest devotion and unalterable attachment.</p>

<p>Shortly after this interview, the young men
met at the table of their hospitable host;
and there for the first time John Ferguson
discovered the position in which the young
physician stood to the family. He watched
with a jealous eye the movements of his rival,
who, though noticing a peculiarity in his
young friend's manner, never dreamt of the
true cause of his dejection. The contention
in the breast of the lady was equally painful;
for, while she divined the nature of Ferguson's
melancholy, and was aware that the young
doctor's attentions to her would lead her
taciturn lover to imagine she was gratified
with and encouraged them, she could give
him no clue to her own feelings; while her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
devotion to parental authority deterred her
from slighting her more voluble admirer, and
her kind and amiable disposition shrank from
assuming a state of feelings foreign to her
nature. John Ferguson retired from the
presence of his loved one, with a heavier
heart than he had ever experienced before;
and, after being the prey to a series of mental
convulsions, at a late hour of the night he
retired, not to sleep, but to a further meditation
in a horizontal position. The morning
dawned without any alleviation of his miseries,
and, on the impulse of his natural impetuosity,
he formed those plans which entirely altered
the course of his subsequent prospects and
career.</p>

<p>The Australian colonies, at this time, were
attracting public attention, and John Ferguson
determined to escape from his thraldom and
misery, by chalking out a home for himself at
the antipodes; his fancy lending its aid to
picture the realisation of a fortune, and the
oblivion of his misplaced affection. This reso<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>lution
once formed, he determined to carry it
out in such a way as to preclude the possibility
of being deterred by any undue influence;
and without acquainting any of his
friends of his designs, he took his departure,
merely writing to his mother the cause of his
sudden flight. In this letter to his parent, as
may be imagined, he expatiated on the beauty,
grace, accomplishments, and virtues of the
unwitting instrument of his expatriation;
confessed his undying love with his usual
enthusiasm, and expressed his belief in her
perfect indifference to his sufferings. He also
stated that the lady had accepted the addresses
of another; and while he deprecated
his inability, through the disparity of their
positions, to make any formal advances or
obtain a footing of equality with his more
favoured rival, he declared his decision,
rather than submit to the torture he was
enduring, to leave the country and constitute
himself in a distant land the architect of
his own fortune. He concluded by breathing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the tenderest affection for his parents, and
entreating their forgiveness for his seeming
neglect, in parting from them in so cold and
unceremonious a manner.</p>

<p>The surprise and consternation of the young
man's friends, occasioned by the receipt of
this letter, may well be imagined; and if
John Ferguson had not been bordering on
insanity when he made his rash resolve, he
would have hesitated ere he had been the
cause of that anguish, which, in his calmer
moments, he well knew would be felt. But
the past was irrevocable; and the remorse he
felt for his neglect and inconsideracy, as his
native land receded from his view, still further
embittered a spirit surcharged with grief.</p>

<p>The painful throes of his mother's heart, felt
at the loss of her son, was far surpassed by
the indignation of his father, who, with his
consanguineous prejudices, and supercilious
contempt for riches unaccompanied by birth,
deemed the claims of his son by blood far
superior to the pretensions of the plebeian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
trader. He only saw in the confessions of his
son, the result of a deep-laid plot for his entrapment
and ruin, and could only believe his
malady to be the result of a collusion on the
part of Miss Williamson and her father, by
whose joint wiles and chicanery the young
man's peace of mind had been destroyed, and
he driven from the land. In the firm belief
of this, he wrote to Mr. Williamson, adverting
in the strongest terms to the injury he conceived
himself to have sustained at his hands,
couching his epistolary invective in no very
polite or considerate language, and enclosing
the young man's letter to his mother as a
documentary proof.</p>

<p>This communication had the effect, at first,
of raising the merchant's ire; but, upon more
deliberate consideration, his wrath gave way
to pity for the father, in whom, through the
haughtiness of his clannish spirit, he could
detect the anguish for a son's loss, and for the
young man, whose sudden disappearance had
been to him inexplicable, but in whose conduct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
he discovered the workings of an honourable
nature. With this feeling in his breast, he
forewent the indulgence of that animosity that
was likely to be occasioned by the letter from
the old laird; and he replied to it in a strain
of cordiality and commiseration, disavowing,
on the part of himself and his daughter, the
application of any influence on the feelings of
his son calculated to destroy his peace of
mind; and denying, until the perusal of the
young man's letter, any knowledge of his sentiments
towards his daughter, and his entire
ignorance of the cause of his disappearance.
We may premise, that this explanation brought
no further intercourse between the heads of the
families, and that Mr. Williamson, though he
believed that, if the intimacy between his
daughter and young Ferguson had continued,
the esteem which she entertained for his young
friend would have developed itself into a reciprocation
of those sentiments which it was
evident had actuated the young man in his
confession and flight; yet, at the same time,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
he did not conceive it possible, in the absence
of any confession to his daughter, that such
feelings could have existed in her breast.
Therefore he deemed it quite unnecessary to
explain to her the information he had obtained,
more especially as she had made no enquiry
as to the cause of Ferguson's absence, nor even
mentioned his name. Though, as we have said,
Miss Williamson preserved a perfect silence on
the name of the absentee, yet she was fully
sensitive to the nature of his feelings, and
pretty shrewdly divined the cause of his flight.
In the midst of this, while the lady's mind
was racked by love, pity, and disappointment,
the young physician pressed for a further
contemplation of his suit, and met with a
repulse; which, though kind, and expressive
of gratitude, was such as to smother any
hope that he might have entertained of the
possession of her devotion. To her father,
this decision was the annihilation of a long
cherished expectancy; but respecting his child's
feelings, and being convinced she must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
been actuated by some strong motives in her
refusal, he refrained from pressing the cause
of his friend, or enquiring the nature of his
daughter's objections. It was only then that
the light flashed across his mind, that his
daughter might have loved young Ferguson;
and he then determined, through his correspondents
in New South Wales, to which
colony the young man had emigrated, to keep
his eye upon him; and, if conducive to the
happiness of his daughter, to further his prospects
by an unforeseen agency.</p>

<p>Some time had elapsed from the period of
which we speak; and young Ferguson, by his
persevering industry, and the influence and
assistance of some friends, who had sought
and cultivated his acquaintance through the
solicitation of his kind and generous patron,
Mr. Williamson, had obtained a position of
comfort and moderate competency. In the
meantime, matters had gone on with the
Williamsons very much as usual, until the
mental anxiety, occasioned by some severe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
reverses in busines, had prostrated the merchant
on a bed of sickness, where the
affectionate energies of the daughter, in her
ministerial responsibilities, were displayed in
their brightest effulgence.</p>

<p>During one of her occasions of attendance,
she was requested by her father to select from
papers in his cabinet some documents to
which he wished to refer; and while in the
execution of this duty, her eye chanced to fall
upon one, the peculiar chirography of which
was strange to her, though in its body she
more than once caught the repetition of her
own name. She took up the paper to satisfy
herself as to its authorship, and her surprise
was immeasurable when she glanced at the
extended sheet and noticed the autograph of
John Ferguson, and throughout the whole
epistle discovered the fervent breathings of
a deep affection for herself. From the reverie
into which she fell, she was aroused by the
voice of her father, and retracing her steps
slowly and noiselessly to his bedside, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
giving vent to her emotions in a deep sigh,
she placed the letter in his hands. The sick
man glanced at it, and then at the face of his
daughter, who answered his enquiring look
by putting the question, "and this sacrifice,
then, was for me?"</p>

<p>"Say not sacrifice, my child," replied the
parent; "the young man has prospered as he
deserved. I periodically hear of his welfare;
for, believing from circumstances that transpired
that you sympathized with him, I felt
an interest in his career. I now see that my
surmises were correct, that you loved one
another, though nothing on the subject was
ever breathed between you; and I have no
fear, if God spares me to rise from this bed,
but that I shall shortly see you both happy."</p>

<p>He was as good as his word; for, being soon
sufficiently recovered to resume his occupation,
he took an early opportunity of corresponding
with young Ferguson, explaining how he came
into possession of the secret of his heart; how
he had made himself acquainted with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
course of his life, relating the circumstance of
his discovering his daughter's feelings; and
expressing his entire concurrence in their
marriage, if the young man retained his
attachment. It is almost unnecessary to say,
this brought a response in person, and resulted
in the happy union of the young people. Mr.
Williamson, whose business had not prospered
very well of late years, broke up his establishment
and accompanied his daughter and son-in-law
to Sydney, where he settled; while the
young couple proceeded to the station of the
bridegroom. It is at this spot we now find
them still located, happy and prosperous, and
blessed with a family of whom they were
justly proud.</p>

<p>The eldest son, John, was a fine handsome
young man, of about two-and-twenty, tall and
robust, with regular and pleasing features,
rather florid complexion, light brown hair,
beard and moustache, with a disposition kind
and generous, and a manner sedate and
retiring. Our friend William, whose ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>quaintance
we have already formed, was a
fine lively fellow of about twenty, not quite
so tall as his brother, with a cheerful and
pleasant countenance, a profusion of rich
curly flaxen hair, and a disposition the
counterpart of his father's. Their sister, Kate,
was the third. She was about eighteen years
of age, in the first blush and florescence of
youth; the idol of her parents, and the pet
of her brother William (whom she resembled
in her disposition and complexion), while she
seemed to have inherited her mother's beauty
and virtues. Besides these, there were three
other children, two girls and a boy; but as we
shall have no occasion to notice them in our
narrative, we will merely mention that they
were as pretty and interesting, and as well
conducted and dutiful, as children usually
are.</p>

<p>Though this family had rarely been away
from their home in the bush, and seldom
called upon to exercise their hospitality on
others than the neighbouring settlers, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
receive their father's magisterial friends,
they possessed all the acquirements of a
polished education, and the ease, grace, and
elegance of a fashionable training, more as
an inherent quality of their nature than as
the effect of example from their neighbours.</p>

</div>


<p>When William Ferguson left the presence
of his sister, he hastened with his sable attendant
to overtake his brother; whom he joined
a few miles on the road. As might have been
gathered from his conversation with his sister,
the object of the brothers in undertaking their
present journey, was to visit some tracts of
country, the right of tenure to which was
offered them by the possessor for sale; and if
the nature of the country pleased and suited
their views, it was the intention of their father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
to purchase it, and start them in life, by
giving them sufficient sheep to commence
stocking it. To decide upon the eligibleness
of the run, they had appointed to meet the
vendor at his station, and to proceed together
to the ground, inspect it, and form their own
opinion of its capabilities. With this intention,
they had left Acacia creek early in the
day, to enable them to reach the town of
Warwick before night, and their place of
appointment by the close of the third day.</p>

<p>New England, in the northern portion of
which their father's station was situated, is
separated from what was then known as the
Moreton Bay district by a geographical
boundary, formed by the peculiar face of the
country; consisting of stony plains and bare
ridges, and establishing a natural division in
the courses of the rivers, the routes of traffic,
and the intercourse of the people.</p>

<p>Moreton Bay, which is situated on the
eastern shore of the Australian continent,
about five hundred miles north of Sydney,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
was first settled as a penal colony in the year
1824, and retained its position, as one of the
vilest hells and sinks of iniquity, until the
year 1842; when, to satisfy the enterprizing
demand of the settlers for new country to
occupy with their herds, convicts were withdrawn,
and the district thrown open to free
settlement. The country to the back of this,
and skirting the coast, is mostly undulating;
in some parts very broken and hilly, and traversed
by rivers of considerable size. Parallel
to the coast line, at an average distance of
from fifty to seventy miles, the land rises
abruptly and almost precipitously, in what is
called the "Main Range," to an altitude of some
three thousand feet, and extends in rich and
fertile plains for thousands of square miles.
This table-land, covered with the most luxurient
pasturage, and displaying an unbroken
extent of splendid country, like a succession
of highly cultivated parks, is known as the
"Darling Downs," and at the time of Mr.
Ferguson's settlement of Acacia creek was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
conceived to be only a trackless waste, offering
no inducement to squatters to risk their lives
and property in its settlement or exploration.
Such, however, was the rapidity, when its
value became known, with which flocks after
flocks poured into "the Downs," following
the footsteps of the first pioneer, that in the
course of a few years, what was before an
unknown wilderness, became one of the most
favoured and thriving of the pastoral districts
of the colony. It was approaching this
delectable land, then, that we left our young
heroes, when making this digression.</p>

<p>They had journeyed some time over these
dividing plains, depending more in their
course upon the position of the sun, than on
any visible road or track, when they determined
to push on for Warwick; as, owing to
the dilatory manner in which they had been
riding, they had still a long distance to proceed,
and the sun was fast sinking on the
horizon. They accordingly urged their horses
into a sharp canter; and soon emerged from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the barren part through which they had been
journeying, into the more hospitable country
approaching the town; where they purposed
halting for the first night.</p>

<p>As the sun sank below the western hills our
travellers drew near, by one of the three converging
roads, the antipodean town of Warwick;
which, to describe to the reader, we need
only to say, seen at a short distance, bears a
striking resemblance to an English village,
and will sustain very creditable comparison
with some of the prettiest in our blessed and
favoured isle. This view, however, the young
men were not at the time permitted to enjoy;
as in that country, where there is little or no
twilight, darkness almost instantly succeeds
sunset; and the panorama that lay stretched
before them was rendered indistinct by the
fast approaching shades of night. Pleasing
as Warwick appears at a distant view, upon
a close inspection the favourable impression
of a stranger is likely in a great measure to
be dispelled; for there is about it, in common
with all other bush towns, an air of careless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>ness
and discomfort, calculated to destroy the
interest felt by its extreme freshness and
novelty. One or two pretty wide streets
may be noticed laid out at right angles,
their lines and extent being presented to
the eye, by the fences enclosing the inhabitants'
properties, and residences; which are
sparsely distributed over the extent of the
settlement; frequently leaving entire unenclosed
gaps in the lines of streets. The houses
are built according to the will or caprice of
the owner, without any degree of uniformity,
in all imaginable positions, and of all possible
architecture; some few of brick, but the majority
of wood (either weather-board or slab).
Here, you may see a fine brick edifice facing
the main street, containing possibly a large
shop and store-house, with a comfortable
dwelling; and forming one line of buildings,
which are faced by a deep verandah, on the
part of which before the shop goods of all
descriptions may be seen exposed. This is
easily recognised as the establishment of the
principal store-keeper of the town; while his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
less opulent trading brethren carry on their
vocations in humbler tenements. On the
opposite side of the street will be perceived
a long one-storied building, also with a verandah
(on to which all the rooms open by
means of French lights); and, even without the
aid of the pendent sign, would be readily distinguished
as the principal hotel. In one end
of the building will be situated the bar, where
the common herd congregate in their libations,
and in the other the coffee-room; where the
more exalted lords of the creation assemble to
discuss, at the same time, the liquors and
edibles of mine host, their own local politics,
and bucolic topics; ever the subjects of paramount
importance to the squatter.</p>

<p>In all probability, the next habitation will
be a slab hut, roofed with sheets of bark; the
whole structure standing on a spot of ground
about eight feet square, not even dignified or
protected by a fence, and contrasting strangely
with the adjoining property. Here we will
have an enclosure of about an acre of ground;
displaying, in its tastefully laid out grass plots<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and flower beds, the neatly trimmed creepers,
and the air of order and comfort about the
pretty little cottage which stands in the
centre of this Eden, the taste for refinement,
tranquillity, permanent settlement, and happiness,
so rarely to be met with in the bush.
The cottage is a square four-roomed one, with
detached kitchen and out-houses. It is built
of what are called weather boards, that is
planks sawn diagonally so as to be of the
thickness of about one inch at one edge, and
about a quarter of an inch on the other. In
the construction of such a house, the form, or
skeleton, is erected first, and these boards are
then affixed so as to overlap one another; each
plank as it is put on being made to cover,
with its thick side, the thin edge of the one
preceding it: thus being alike impervious to
wind and weather. The roof is shingled, or,
in other words, covered with pieces of wood
split into much the same shape as narrow slates,
and put on in a similar manner. The cottage
has a verandah on its front, enclosed by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
small railing, tastefully painted, and ornamented
with a few running plants, which
intwine its posts; and, while charming the
eye, lend the delicacy of their fragrance to
render to this spot the enchantment of an Arcadian
bower, when the family adjourn thence
from the interior of the house, to enjoy the
refreshing zephyrs of the summer evenings.
The windows facing this verandah are made
to open in the French fashion, so that, upon
opening any one of them, a person can step
out at once; they are protected from the sun
by venetians, which are generally folded back,
and which, with the railings of the verandah,
are painted green, while the house itself is
scrupulously white. The door is of polished
cedar, and adorned with a bright brass
knocker and plate, which may possibly have
done service in London, or some other city or
town in the old country. Picture such a spot
as this in the imagination, kind reader; and
some idea may be formed of the residence of
the medical man of the place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>The feeling of admiration, occasioned by
witnessing the charming domicile of the local
disciple of &AElig;sculapius, is only equalled by the
disgust experienced at gazing on the apparent
wreck, filth, and squallor of the next tenement.
Standing contiguous is another such
hut; prevented only by the support of a
stout pole, which props its frail and shaken
frame, from ending that miserable existence
of which it seems ashamed; while it proclaims
its humility by an apparent emulation of the
posture of that far-famed structure of Pisa.
This dwelling is probably followed by an
edifice of a similar kind, though of more
spacious dimensions and solid construction;
and, by the sparks emitted from a low
chimney, the din of the workman's hammer,
and the dull heavy sound of the bellows, is
distinguished as the abode of the village
Vulcan; while the surrounding yard, with
drays in various stages of dilapidation,
wheels, poles, axles, and other dismemberments
strewing the ground, presents the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
appearance of a perfect vehicular golgotha.
With one or two wool-laden drays drawn up
before a public-house, in which the guardians
of the tractive animals, and who are designated
bullock-drivers, are solacing themselves
with a plentiful libation of the liquor which
cheers and also inebriates; a similar ponderous
vehicle, stationed before the door of the first
described premises, undergoing the operation
of lading with stores for a distant station; a
few horses tied up to the posts in front of the
hotels; a few equestrians; as many pedestrians;
a sprinkling of the sable sons of the soil in
all imaginable variety of costumes, composed
of the left-off garments of their fair-skinned
brethren; here, a gigantic denizen of the
forest standing in the centre of a street,
raising his majestic head high above the
settlement, and seeming to look down with
lofty contempt on the scenes enacted beneath
him; there, the charred stump of
another tree, with its semi-calcined trunk
lying by its side, where it had fallen at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
some remote period, perhaps years before
the settlement had been thought of; but had
never been removed, on the principle that
each burgess thought it no business of his,
and the one most interested and affected never
dreaming that a small personal outlay of
money and trouble would be of considerable
benefit and advantage to himself; in the wet
weather, with the streets, which are nothing
but the surface soil without any improvement,
save the hardening of continual traffic in the
dry season, transformed into a mass of mud
and mire, into which drays sometimes sink to
their axles, equestrians to their horse's knees,
and foot passengers, unless well acquainted
with their location, often plunge only to
extricate themselves with the loss of a boot;
and with the occasional enclosures in the
neighbourhood, of paddocks more or less
covered with trees, interspersed by numerous
fallen and rotting trunks, half burnt logs,
and gigantic stumps, the reader has a general
description of bush towns, and (with some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
slight and insignificant modifications) of the
town of Warwick. They rarely have much
industry, and as little enterprise; while, there
being no extensive demand for artistic or
mechanical labour, and no agricultural pursuits,
the inhabitants are generally dependent
upon the trade arising from their intercourse
with the squatters.</p>

<p>As we have already informed the reader, it
was nearly dark when the young Fergusons
rode into Warwick; and dismounting at the
door of the "Bullock's Head," leaving their
horses and packs to the charge of their black
boy Joey, they ensconced themselves in the
general apartment of the hostlery dignified
by the name of coffee-room. If the room had
few pretensions to elegance, it had less to
cleanliness, and least of all to comfort; its
furniture consisted of a long table, protected
by an oil-cloth cover, on which stood a hand
bell, and a jug containing water of very
questionable purity. Around it were arranged
a number of solid cedar chairs, in the manu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>facture
of which the desideratum to be attained
seemed to have been a capacity to withstand
the rough usage they were destined to endure;
and they bore unmistakable evidences of
having, at various periods of their existence,
taken part in some severe and desperate conflicts.
On the mantelpiece stood some stoneware
representations of maids and swains, who
combined a pastoral occupation with the
gratification of a musical talent; while they
gazed with a languishing air on their protrusive
neighbour, a portly individual with a
highly-coloured, rubicund, and grinning physiognomy,
and scalpless cranium, from which he
invited the lovers of the narcotic weed to
extract a supply of that universal solace.
These were supported, on the background, by
a mirror of ordinary size; which presented
unmistakable signs of the household's reluctance
to disturb the sacred dust of ages. Its
sides and corners had a very dingy appearance,
like an opaque coating, which left a circle in
the centre of dim translucency; and from this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
circumstance, a visitor might have assumed
that some individual, wishing to gratify his
vanity by seeing a reflection of his own visage,
had applied his sleeve, at the same time that
he exercised his arm in a rotary motion, to
remove the impediments to such vision. The
lining of boards to the room had been covered,
in the general ornature, with a gorgeous
coloured paper; but no precaution had been
taken to provide for the wood's shrinking, and
the consequence was that the paper had split
with the timber's contraction, and left a gap
between each board it covered. Around the
walls were distributed some antique prints,
such as Queen Victoria in her gracious teens,
considerably discoloured by the application of
water, in a manner in no way advantageous
to her complexion; a coloured print of the
Derby in "the good old times," and the representation
of a naval conflict executed in a
bold and imposing style, with a studied disregard
to perspective. The floor was covered
with a dingy half worn oil-cloth; while half a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
dozen men were sitting at the table smoking,
drinking, and maintaining an animated and
boisterous dialogue upon the relative merits
of their horses. Such then was the place and
company in which our young friends found
themselves, and were hardly noticed as they
rang the bell to attract the attention of some
one in the house. Their summons was, after
a time, answered by a bare-armed, bearded,
and greasy-looking biped of the genus homo,
honoured by the confidence of the landlord,
deigning to fill the post of waiter, and, from
a deformity of his person, rejoicing in the
soubriquet of "Hopping Dick."</p>

<p>To a request, to be shown a room which
they might appropriate for the night, the
brothers were ushered into a crib leading out
of the coffee-room, and measuring about eight
feet square; while on each side of it was
stationed a bed of similar dimensions to a
coffin, with appurtenances of relative magnitude.
After depositing their valises and
ordering a meal, they strolled out to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
stables to see that Joey had well looked after
their horses; and, upon their recal by the
limping Ganymede, turned into the house to
partake of their repast. During their short
absence, the company had increased by the
entrance of a few of the towns-people, who
had joined the circle, and added fresh impetus
to the argument (if their disjointed disputation
could be called such), and stimulated an increased
devotion at the shrine of Bacchus.
Amid this earthly pandemonium, John Ferguson
and his brother sat down to discuss their
meal.</p>

<p>The "fast" style of life, so common among
the early settlers in the bush, but now happily
dying out, rarely found favour in the eyes of
the native youths of the colony; and the
Fergusons, having been brought up to entertain
an abhorence of such scenes, naturally
felt a repugnance to the society into which
they now found themselves thrown. Curiosity
to see the termination of their companion's
orgies, however, detained them in the room;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and for the consummation of their desire, they
were not destined to wait long.</p>

<p>The party consisted principally of individuals
called "supers," or more properly speaking,
the superintendents of stations, the
owners of which were not resident on their
properties; and in the management of
which, excepting the disposal of stock, they
had entire control: a few settlers of considerable
means, whose stations, being situated in
the remote bush, afforded them very rare
opportunities of visiting town, but, when such
an occasion presented itself, it was the means
of supplying an indulgence, such as the present,
of the wildest and most reckless course of dissipation
that could be devised: one or two
settlers of minor importance, and dignified
with the title of "stringy bark" or "cockatoo"
squatters: and, as we have already said, one
or two of the towns-people, who would run
into any excess, and expose themselves to
any expense and ignominy, to court the
patronage, conversation, and companionship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
of the squatter, who in his sobriety would not
condescend even to recognise him, made up
the group.</p>

<p>At one end of the table, sat a squatter of
collosal size, whose features were hardly discernible
from the hair that almost covered his
face. He was dressed in the usual bush costume:
that is, a low-crowned, broad-brimmed
hat, made of the platted fibre of the cabbage
tree, and called after the plant from which
it is named, "a cabbage tree hat;" a loose
woollen frock, barely covering his hips, made
so as, in putting on and taking off, to require
slipping over the head, and as a garment of
constant use, is elegantly designated "a
jumper;" and heavy knee riding boots with
spurs. The name in which he seemed to
be recognised, from its frequent mention
by the company, was Smith. Adding to
his uncouth appearance and wild gesticulation,
he had a voice decidedly unmusical; while
his conversation was copiously interlarded with
expletives, anathematizing some portion of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
anatomy. This was the presiding spirit of the
conclave.</p>

<p>The excitement by this time ran high; great
had been the exploits detailed by the company
of their various steeds, and the dangers through
which they had carried their several owners;
while the prodigies of speed, power, patience,
and endurance, enumerated of the wonderful
animals, would have made even Bucephalus
hang his head at the idea of his own ordinary
capacity. How long this state of braggadocio
would have lasted, it is impossible to say;
probably until a vinous philanthropy subdued
the mental faculties of the company, and acted
as an opiate on their senses, by composing
them to sleep under the canopy (not of
heaven), but of the table. But the mere
relation of deeds was speedily brought to a
stand, by the challenge of Smith to bet "a
shout" to the party all round, or accept the
same himself from any one there, that he
would ride his own horse into the room, and
leap him over the table without touching or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
displacing anything on it. No one of the
boasted equestrians offered to perform the feat;
though the bet was readily accepted involving
Smith's performance of the exploit; but before
we proceed to detail the attempt, we may be
permitted to enlighten our readers upon the
nature of the bet. "A shout," in the parlance
of the Australian bush, is an authority or request
to the party in waiting in a public-house
to supply the bibulous wants of the companions
of the shouter, who of course bears
the expense; and when a shout is proffered as
an earnest of sociality, or as an obligation in a
bet, it indicates the disposition, in the one
case, to increase as much as possible the cost
of the shout, while it involves the necessity,
in the other, to provide whatever is required
by the recipients.</p>

<p>Smith speedily appeared with his horse
saddled and ready for the leap; and to give
him a better opportunity of performing his
task, his friends had removed the table to a
transverse position, and stationed themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
along the sides of the room, to witness the
performance: carrying on their conversation
in as animated a spirit as ever; while varying
their opinions of his chances of success with
bets on the event, and arrangements for fresh
trials of a similar kind.</p>

<p>The landlord, who from the increased din
and uproar, imagined something was astir,
made enquiries of his oleaginous-looking
colleague, by whom he was apprised of the
proceedings; but being accustomed to scenes
of equal recklessness, and being, moreover, a
discreet man, and anticipating, in the event of
any breakages, a means of reaping a plentiful
harvest, he was conveniently deaf, and found
occasion for his presence at a spot far removed
from the scene of action. From his retreat,
however, he was speedily summoned by
Hopping Dick, to witness the result of the
man&oelig;uvre.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to describe the scene
that presented itself to the landlord's vision,
upon his entering the coffee-room; where, from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the boisterous laughing of some of the party,
the interjective swearing of others, the Babel
of voices advising and expostulating, and the
crowding in of the towns-people, who had
been attracted to the house by a rumour of
what was going on,&mdash;he could hardly discern
the nature of the accident, the extent of the
injury sustained, or, what concerned him
most, the damage done to his furniture and
premises. Upon clearing the room of strangers,
and removing, as far as possible, the signs of
wreck, he retired, leaving his lodgers to their
meditations; while he indulged in calculations
bearing a direct application on the late amphitheatre
practice. He was, as we have already
said, a prudent man in matters of monetary
interest, and he wished not to question the
acts of gentlemen residing in his house, and
therefore desired no explanation; but, for the
reader's enlightenment, we will briefly detail
the circumstances that occasioned this untoward
event.</p>

<p>Smith brought his horse, which was a noble<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
high-bred animal, into the room; and when
the door was closed, he mounted for the leap.
Intoxicated as he was, it was evident from his
deportment he was a good rider; and sitting
well and firmly in his saddle, was certainly a
picture for admiration; though, to a thoughtful
mind, the feeling would give rise to a
regret, that some more dignified object had
not called forth the energies of the man, than
that which made a ridiculous exhibition of
himself, degraded his noble steed, and risked
his own neck. However, no such remorse entered
the breast of the redoubtable horseman;
and with a glance of conscious success directed
round the room at his anticipating companions,
he dashed spurs into the sides of his
steed. The animal thus urged, apparently
terrified with the uproar that assailed his ears,
and hardly knowing, in the singularity of the
situation, what was required of him, exhibited
symptoms of terror and uneasiness. His rider,
however, was not to be deterred from his purpose,
and bringing him up to the edge of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
table, again administered the spurs at the
same time that he raised him to the leap;
while the horse, frightened by the excited
throng around him, and having his metal
thoroughly aroused, made one bound, more
than adequate to take him clear of the table.
The rider not anticipating so lofty a spring,
and incautiously omitting to take due precaution
in the suddenness of his exaltation,
allowed his head to come in violent contact
with the ceiling; which stunning him, and
causing him, in his attempt to recover himself,
to suddenly draw up his reins, had the effect
of swerving his horse from his balance, and
brought the pair down amidst the symbols of
the late revel. While they lay stretched on
the floor, surrounded by the ruins of the table
and the fragments of glass, both bleeding and
bruised, the landlord made his appearance;
and after removing the astonished quadruped
to more congenial quarters, the frolicsome and
sportive inebriates separated for the night.</p>

<p>The thoughts of the young men, as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
retired to rest, after having been the silent
spectators of the late scene, may well be
imagined; such to them was entirely new,
and the disgust which it gave rise to in the
mind of John was fully equalled by the contempt
engendered in that of William; though,
it must be confessed, when the contemplation
of the event passed through the latter's brain,
he could not refrain from indulging in a
laugh at the ridiculous appearance of the
actors, and from feeling amused at the
humiliating termination of the vain gasconade
of the pompous and conceited principal, who
became a self-immolated victim to his own
vanity. The only object that excited one
spark of William's pity or sympathy, was the
poor deluded horse. With these reflections,
and an occasional outbreak of reminiscent
cachinnations on the part of the junior, the
brothers dropt off to sleep, tired with the day's
journey and the events of the night.</p>

<p>Early on the following morning, John and
William prepared to resume their journey;
and, upon a settlement of their reckoning with
their host, they were not a little surprised and
annoyed to find a considerable item in their
bill set down for the damage caused by the
previous night's debauch. This exaction they
resisted, but to no purpose. The landlord
was no respecter of persons, and was inexorable
in his demands; they were present during
the scene, and consequently, in his eyes, im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>plicated
and liable to pay for their pleasure.
Besides which, he intended to reap a rich
harvest from the event, and charge the same
to each party staying in his house; notwithstanding
that the sum apportioned to each
individual was ample to indemnify him for
any loss he had sustained. Not being in the
habit, however, of having his demands called
into question, he was not in this case inclined
to relinquish his intention of enforcing the
payment; and the brothers were therefore
constrained to submit to the extortion.</p>

<p>The shortest though more intricate route
to Brompton, the station of Mr. Smithers, was
through the bush, following a line described to
them by an old shepherd of their father's who
well knew that part of the country; and,
being experienced bushmen themselves, they
determined upon taking that course in preference
to the more circuitous, though better
defined, dray road and townships. With this
intention, provided with a descriptive sketch
of the country, a pocket compass, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
sagacity and instinct of their black boy, they
started for Barra Warra, a station distant about
fifty miles; which was centrally situated, and
from whence there was a postman's track to
Brompton. To reach this point before dark,
it was necessary to push on; as, should they
not complete their distance in daylight, it
would necessitate the alternative of spending
a night in the bush; a circumstance, which,
though not likely to cause any uneasiness to a
bushman, was, in the possibility of obtaining
comfortable quarters, as well to be avoided.</p>

<p>Nothing of any note occurred in the ride,
until well on in the afternoon; when they
began to detect signs of their approach to an
extensive station, and expected shortly to
witness symptoms of animation and habitation.
The weather during the greater part of
the day had been exceedingly sultry; which,
with the heavy appearance of the sky, was
a portentous indication of storm. In order to
escape this, and reach the shelter of the station
before the rending of the heavens, the young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
men urged their weary horses to an accelerated
speed. They rode on; still without coming
upon any track that would guide them to the
station they knew could not be far distant;
when an occasional low rumbling noise of
distant thunder announced the approach of
the warring elements; and with the gradual
extinction of the sun's rays, made them feel
the unpleasantness of their situation, and a
desire to be well housed. The instinct of the
black here made its value apparent; for, where
nothing was visible even to the practised eye
of either John or William, he suddenly discerned
the tracks of sheep; and naturally
inferring that they must either be directed
towards, or from, the head station; and also
detecting the track of the shepherd, who must
have accompanied the flock, easily deciding
which must have been the homeward course,
he took the lead of the party, and piloted
them with his eyes fixed upon the ground;
travelling as speedily as their horses could
proceed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>Very little distance, however, had been accomplished;
and the increasing gloom lent its
darkness to the shades of night already setting
in; when a few heavy drops of moisture, accompanied
by a flash of vivid light, that made
the horses start and tremble; and followed by
a peal of thunder that seemed to shake the
very earth; announced to the travellers that
they were in for an unpleasant experience, in
all probability, of a miserable night. The trio,
however, still held on their way; the black
boy, during the momentary illuminations
caused by the repeated flashes of lightning,
continued to discern the, but to him, evanescent
path; and with spasmodic starts; and
intervals of salient progression, proceeded in
his guiding course.</p>

<p>The appearance of the forest was fearfully
sublime; the tall bare trunks of the gigantic
gum-trees, with their surfaces of immaculately
smooth bark of a pale bluish hue, appearing
as if they had by some unaccountable agency
been stripped of their natural skin, contrasted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
strangely with the surrounding gloom. When
the momentary flashes of light lit up the
darkness of the woods, and revealed the naked
stems, like argenteous columns supporting the
black canopy of eternal shades, they displayed
a scene calculated to create in an imaginative
fancy the existence of a vast catacomb of
departed dryads; while it inspired the mind
with awe, at the presence of the dread power
that moves the spirit of the storm. Still, down
came the rain; flash followed upon flash; and
the thunder rolled as if the whole heavens
were rent by the mighty convulsions of the
elements. The storm by this time had reached
the culminating point; and the volume of
water, pouring upon the earth, gave to the
ground the appearance of one vast swamp;
while it obliterated, even to the acute vision of
the black, all signs of the track that had been
leading them to their night's destination.
Nothing now seemed to offer them any chance
of an alleviation of their discomfort; no sound
could be caught by the quick ear of Joey, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
would tend to lead them to the desired refuge;
no abatement of the storm appeared probable;
and in the perfect obscurity of the night, any
removal from their present position would only
involve them, in all probability, more in the
bush, and render their extrication more tedious
and difficult. To add to their misery, they
were cold and drenched, had no possibility
of lighting a fire, or indulging in that balm for
every misfortune, a pipe; and with their horses
almost knocked up, they saw no alternative
but to take what little protection a tree
afforded, and wait for the morning.</p>

<p>Their position had attained this climax of
wretchedness, when it struck John Ferguson
that Joey might be able to hear or see something
from the top of one the trees, that
would lead them to shelter; he therefore requested
the black, as a forlorn hope, to try it.
Joey, upon receiving his command, selected a
piece of wild vine sufficiently long to give
him a firm hold in each hand, while it compassed
the trunk of a good-sized tree; then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
divesting himself of his boots, and choosing
one of the largest stems he could distinguish,
he prepared to mount an old blue gum, whose
trunk rose for fully forty feet smooth and
straight, and without an impediment or excrescence.
Putting his supple vine-stalk round
the tree, and firmly grasping each end of the
cane by his hands, he placed his feet firmly
against the stalwart denizen of the woods, and
rose in bounding starts with a celerity astonishing
to the uninitiated. Upon reaching the
fork of the tree, and ascending the highest
branch, he spent some moments gazing around,
in the hope of detecting a friendly light in the
surrounding gloom, but without success; not
a gleam was visible, and not a sound, save the
rumbling of the thunder and the heavy pattering
of the rain, broke the solemn monotony
of the storm. Disappointed and nearly disheartened,
he communicated to his master
below the ungrateful intelligence that nothing
was perceptible; but preparatory to his descent,
he gave a loud "cooey," in the faint hope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
that it might attract the attention of some
human being. As we proceed, we may as well
describe to the reader the nature of this signal.
A "cooey" is, as its name implies, a call having
the sound its orthography indicates; with a
prolonged dwelling upon the first syllable, and
a sharp determined utterance in its termination.
This sound, which is peculiar to the
Australian bush, uttered with the intonation
and force of healthy lungs, can be heard at a
surprising distance; and often, when used by
one lost in the nemoral labyrinths of the
country, is the means of attraction; and consequent
deliverance from danger and probable
death.</p>

<p>It was, then, one of these efficient signals
of distress that was uttered by Joey, with a
lustiness that would have done credit to La
Blache; and great was his joy when, after a
few moments of listening, his ear caught the
sound of a dog's barking. The canine infection
spread rapidly over the settlement, and
once started kept up an unceasing chorus from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
the throats of a whole pack; and guided by
the friendly notice, our travellers were enabled
to discern in which direction Barra Warra lay.
They mounted their horses with stiff and
weary limbs, though with lightened hearts,
and proceeded for about a hundred yards in
the direction whence echoed the barking;
when, to their no little astonishment, they came
upon the line of fence enclosing the paddocks
attached to the house, and immediately struck
the track leading to the station. By this they
had the mortification to discover, that if they
had been enabled to continue their course for
a few minutes before the storm thickened, they
would have, long ere then, been comfortably
sheltered from the inclemency of the weather.
However, they were not in a disposition to
indulge in any vain regrets; and shortly
arriving at the house, they presented themselves
in their sad plight. The noise of
the dogs had attracted the attention of the
people of the place, who, imagining the cause,
were expecting to see the approach of some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
traveller; so, when John and William made
their appearance, they were met at the door
by the owner of the station.</p>

<p>This gentleman upon witnessing the condition
of the young men, and instantly perceiving
them to be of his own order, extended
his hand to each; and expressing his regret
at their misfortune, invited them into the
house, and provided them with dry changes.
A warm repast was quickly ready for them;
and during its discussion they related their
parentage, destination, and object of their
journey, to their new friend, Mr. Dawson;
who proved himself a most agreeable person.
He informed them that he had heard of
their father, and was delighted to make the
acquaintance of his sons; he proffered the
hospitality of his house for as long as they
wished to stay; and pressed them to prolong
their visit. This, however, would involve a
breach of their engagement with Smithers;
and, pleased as they were with the civility and
kindness displayed in the invitation, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
regretted they could not, on that occasion,
accept it, and informed their entertainer that
their object was to reach Brompton on the
following day; which would necessitate a resumption
of their journey early on the morrow.</p>

<p>Mr. Dawson expressed sorrow that he could
not induce them to remain; but trusted they
would make his house their temporary home
on some more convenient occasion; and
informing them that he had then got a few
friends stopping with him on a short visit,
and who were then assembled in the drawing-room,
he led the Fergusons off to introduce
them.</p>

<p>The young men naturally thought the
company, to whom they were about to be
ushered, consisted of some of the neighbouring
squatters, who had volunteered their company
for a few days to dispel their mutual monotony.
But great was their surprise, when,
upon entering a very comfortably (almost
elegantly) furnished room, to see assembled
several ladies, dispersed about the apartment;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
some in conversation with gentlemen; others
at work, amusing or instructing the children;
while one sat at a handsome cottage piano,
running through some new music, brought to
the station by one of her friends; and
accompanying herself on the instrument, while
singing in a sweet and melodious voice a new
and popular song. To her, whom he addressed
as his wife, the host introduced our travellers;
detailing in a few words, the information
respecting their movements, which they had
themselves imparted to him; and then in turn
went through the usual formality with the
remainder of his guests.</p>

<p>In society such as this, where restraint is
unknown, and cordiality and hospitality reign
supreme, it is not to be wondered at that our
friends speedily found themselves at home;
nor that their own prospects were canvassed
by their new friends, with a zeal and freedom
that would be considered unpardonable impertinence
in the more settled and formal circles
of the "old country." From the information<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
obtained from the more experienced settlers,
the Fergusons derived considerable benefit;
and their friends' directions and opinions of
the country, being, in the estimation of the
young men, likely to be valuable, they determined
to allow themselves, in a great
measure, to be guided by them.</p>

<p>The evening, enlivened by an occasional
dance, music, and lively conversation, was
passed exceedingly pleasantly by the brothers;
who were perfectly delighted with their kind
reception; and sadly regretted their inability
to comply with their kind host's repeated
entreaties to extend their visit. Mr. Dawson
informed them that those pleasing reunions,
had become quite numerous in that part of
the country; where the degree of familiar and
friendly intercourse established among the
neighbouring families was such, that, after the
bustle and occupation of shearing time was
over, such a party, as he then had in his house,
was formed alternately at each of the surrounding
stations; and their leisure existence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
became a prolonged life of reciprocal good-feeling
and friendship; which, by the means
of this happy unity, were firmly cemented.</p>

<p>On the following morning, the sun rose
with a refreshed resplendence; and our young
friends, after breakfasting, and taking a cordial
leave of their kind entertainers and their
friends, proceeded on their way to Brompton.
The previous evening's storm had had the
effect of deliciously cooling the atmosphere;
and the sun's clear rays obliquely striking the
fragrant gum-leaves, which fluttered high over-head
in the gentle morning breeze, and still
bathed, as it were, in tears for the late elemental
strife, made them sparkle like glittering gems
in the roof of their arboreous edifice. The
aromatic exudation from the dwarfish wattle,
with its May-like blossom, which seemed to
flourish under the protection of its gigantic
compeers; and the bright acacia, decking, with
its brilliant hue, the sloping sward, both lent
their aid in the general pageant. The shrill
cry of the parrots, which, with their rich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
plumage flashing in the reflection of the
sun, and almost dazzling the eye of the
beholder, as they darted in their continued
flight from tree to tree, in the exuberance
of their conscious freedom and enjoyment of
resuscitated nature, screeched their notes of
thankfulness and admiration. The running
streamlet, called into almost momentary existence,
bounded and leapt its limpid volume
through its tortuous and meandering course,
insinuated its translucent body into masses of
fibrous <i>debris</i> and crevices of rock, to emerge
in miniature cataracts, and murmur its allegiance
to an all-smiling nature. The brightened
face of morn greeted the young men upon
their start; and with their spirits buoyant and
animated by the refreshing influence of the
delightful temperature, the surrounding fragrance,
and the cheerful and exhilarating
aspect of the bush, they rode with light and
happy hearts.</p>

<p>Their course, however, was tedious and
troublesome, and at the same time dangerous;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
for the fury of the storm, which now showed
what had been the extent of its force, in the
destruction it had occasioned, had placed
numerous traps on the road. Immense trees
lay prostrate across their track, frequently
necessitating a deviation from the path. Here
a patriarch of the forest was riven to the root;
with its splinters scattered in all directions;
while one portion, still adhering in its connexion
to the base, and supported by a branch
resting on the ground, formed a triumphal
arch across the road. There a similar denizen
of the woods extended his humiliated form;
torn up by the root, which had drawn with
it masses of its congenial soil, seemingly
unwilling to part with its natural element
from which it had derived its sustenance.
This would cause another deviation; and the
treacherous nature of the ground (which was
what bushmen call rotten, that is, superficially
looking perfectly sound, though actually so
soft that a horse would sink into it to his
knees) rendered travelling insecure, and re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>quired
the exercise of extreme caution. Hence
the day was considerably advanced ere the
travellers arrived at Brompton.</p>

<p>As they approached this station, they were
very much struck with its appearance. It
was situated on a rising ground facing the
Gibson river; which, with the heavy rains that
had fallen, had risen considerably above its
usual height, and had the appearance of a
noble stream. The house itself was of the
kind generally to be met with under similar
circumstances; that is, a one-storied weather-boarded
building of about six or eight rooms,
mostly connected with one another, with a
broad shady verandah, detached kitchen and
stable, and other out-houses at a short distance
removed from the dwelling. As a structure
it had nothing about it that would attract
special attention; it was simply neat, and
had an appearance of comfort; but looked at
in conjunction with the prettily arranged
garden, with its tastefully laid out flower plots,
and well stocked beds of vegetive edibles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>&mdash;and
which was protected from the intrusion of
quadrupeds by a substantial "pailing fence"&mdash;it
was a snug and pleasant residence. Numerous
and extensive enclosed paddocks stretched
far down the banks of the river; and in them
might have been seen quite a herd of horses
luxuriating in the rich pasturage; while at a
distance of a few hundred yards stood the
enclosures forming the stock-yard, and, adjacent,
the large wool-shed and the huts of the
men. From these, smoke with graceful curls
rose in the calm evening air, and gave to the
<i>locale</i> the appearance of a small though
picturesque township; and, with the park-like
appearance of the country, impressed our
young travellers with the feeling, that Brompton
was one of the most serene and delightful
spots they had ever seen.</p>

<p>This station was of considerable magnitude;
and, being in the centre of a district becoming
fast occupied by settlers and their
stock, it was likely, at no very distant period,
to become a place of considerable importance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
The government had reserved a site for a
township; and had already established a branch
post-office for the convenience of the settlers
in the neighbourhood; it might consequently
be considered the <i>ultima thule</i> of civilisation.
The proprietor of the station, Mr.
Alfred Smithers, was a gentleman in the
meridian of life, who had, in the general
exodus from the southern districts of the
colony, come over into the Darling Downs in
search of "new country;" and continuing to
push on until he passed the boundary of the
existing settlements, had alighted on a tract
of land situated near the head of the Gibson
river, to which it appeared no venturesome
squatter had as then penetrated. He took
up the "run" from government, gave it its
present name, brought over his flocks, and
established his station; then building a comfortable
little cottage, which, since the erection
of the present house, had been occupied by
the overseer, he removed to it Mrs. Smithers
and his family. His brother shortly after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>wards
followed him into this unknown wilderness,
and not being possessed of any stock
himself, assisted him in the general management
of the station.</p>

<p>The younger brother, Mr. Robert Smithers,
more generally known among his friends as
Bob Smithers, and of whom we shall have to
make frequent mention in the course of our
narrative, was a gentleman of rather prepossessing
appearance; the junior of his brother
by some ten years; but, unlike him, was of
an unsettled and reckless disposition, rather
fond of the society of wild and dissolute companions,
and at times, when absent from
home, exhibited symptoms of the old colonial
leaven, and indulged in courses of dissipation
and debauchery. On the station, however, he
was energetic and industrious; and, at its early
settlement, was of considerable service to his
brother, not only in the general routine of
the establishment, but from his implacable
enmity to the blacks, whom he inspired with
a wholesome dread of his prowess; so that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
while their neighbours were continually suffering
from the depredations of the sable
marauders, their flocks and property were left
intact.</p>

<p>Shortly after Bob's juncture with his
brother, and perceiving the number of settlers
that continually migrated to this new district,
he provisioned himself and a few domesticated
blacks (that occasionally worked on
the station, and on whom he could depend)
with rations for two or three months; and
being well armed for his own protection, in
case of a collision with any of his colleagues'
countrymen, or of their treachery, he took his
departure on a prospecting tour. Following
the course of the river, and exploring the
creeks and tributaries augmenting it, he drew
a rough sketch or plan of the surface of the
country, noting the different hills, creeks, and
landmarks, to which he gave names; and
marking the trees at various spots, to indicate
to any future searcher that the country
had been selected. He then divided his plan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
into divisions, which he roughly estimated
to contain each about twenty or thirty thousand
acres; and dignifying them with names,
he sent into government, tenders for their
lease. At the time of which we speak, in the
survey department of the legislature, very
little was known of the country designated
"the unsettled districts," but which were fast
filling up; and as little enquiries were made
by the authorities, as to the accuracy of the
sketches and estimations in the tenders, in
the absence of any others, they were necessarily
accepted at the minimum rate of ten
guineas per annum each. Thus Mr. Robert
Smithers became, for a small annual rental,
the lessee of a tract of country equal in
extent to an European principality. Although,
without the present means of stocking the
land thus obtained, Bob Smithers knew
perfectly well that as the country became
taken up and occupied, and as fresh settlers
poured in, he would find many who would
purchase his right to the "runs" at pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
round sums, in preference to pushing out
still further; besides, having no absolute
necessity to sell them, he could continue to
hold out, until their value sufficiently advanced
to induce him to effect a sale. A
prospect of a profitable realization having now
presented itself, he had been offering them;
and it was for one of these runs that the
Fergusons were in treaty.</p>

<p>Their approach to the station had been
noticed from the house; and upon their arrival
at the door, they were welcomed by Mr.
Alfred Smithers, who at once concluded who
they were; so consigning their horses to the
care of a man in waiting and their own black
boy Joey, they entered the domicile, and were
introduced to Mrs. Smithers and the family.
In the absence of his brother, who was shortly
expected in, John fell into conversation with
Mr. Smithers, respecting the country they
were about to visit, and their proposed operations,
should they decide upon purchasing;
while William, with his usual frankness, sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>sided
into a friendly conversation with the
lady, while he playfully noticed the children,
with whom he instantly became a great
favourite.</p>

<p>The internal arrangements of the house
seemed in perfect keeping with its external
appearance of comfort: order, decorum, and
cleanliness, seemed its characteristics; and
happiness and contentment that of the
inmates' existence. Mr. Smithers was evidently
a man of domestic attachments; one
whose greatest pleasure was in his family;
while his wife was blessed with an equally
happy temperament, devoted to her husband,
with whom and her children she divided her
entire affection. Their family consisted of
three, two boys and a girl; who, notwithstanding
the disadvantages under which they
laboured, were exeeedingly obedient and well
mannered, without any of the wayward
forwardness, and rude precosity, so generally
to be met with in children brought up under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>similar auspices. Though hospitable and
kind in the extreme, from their remote and
secluded position, the Smitherses were rarely
visited by strangers; and even their few
neighbours were either located at such considerable
distances that it made visiting
inconvenient, or they were people of a stamp
who had no relish for their society. Mr.
Smithers never visited town, except when
business made it absolutely necessary, and
his amiable wife never entertained any desire
to leave her family; consequently it was not
to be wondered at, from the time of her
arrival at the station, five years before the
period of which we speak, she had never left
it longer than for a day's ride, to return the
courtesies of some of her nearest friends.</p>

<p>Bob Smithers, as we have already said, was
inclined occasionally to exceed the bounds of
temperance and decorum; but even he sincerely
respected his sister-in-law, and never
ventured to violate propriety by the introduction
of such companions as he knew would
be distasteful to her. At the same time, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
influence of her presence acted as a check
upon his wild and uncouth habits, and prevented
him from giving way so entirely to
his reckless propensities as he would have
done under no such restraint.</p>

<p>The Fergusons were well pleased with the
portion of the Smithers' <i>menage</i> they had met;
and during the interval that they were waiting
for the return of Bob, who had, so his brother
informed them, been detained somewhere on
the run, probably through the swollen nature
of the creeks, they enjoyed one of the most
pleasant evenings they had spent for a long
time. The absentee made his appearance late
in the evening, and after a mutual introduction,
informed his visitors that he had
hardly expected them for a day or two. The
rain in the neighbourhood of Brompton, they
discovered, had been falling for some days, and
had been considerably heavier than on the
higher parts of the river; while, owing to the
large body of water that had fallen, Bob stated
that all the rivers were too much swollen to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
admit of their being crossed, and advised, for
their mutual comfort, that their expedition
should be delayed for a few days to give the
water time to subside. This advice was
backed up by the rest of the family, who were
unanimous in expressing the delight they
would feel in their friends extending the term
of their visit; while they, having no objections
themselves to such a course, gladly responded
to the appeal, and considered themselves
stationary until the river would admit of
their proceeding on their expedition. With
this arrangement settled, they finally separated
for the night.</p>

</div>


<p>On the third day after the Fergusons' arrival,
Bob Smithers, believing the river had
sufficiently subsided to admit of their travelling,
organized their party preparatory to
their departure; and selected from his own
men one of the most useful and experienced
bushmen to accompany them, and in conjunction
with Joey, to take charge of the
pack-horses, follow them over the runs, and
guard their camp. They started; and, for the
first day, followed the course of the Gibson
river, which for nearly thirty miles bounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
the Brompton run. At this point its waters
were joined by a tributary creek, and here
was situated one of the out-stations. It was
the intention of Bob Smithers to reach this
place before dark; and, owing to the heavy
nature of the ground, from its excessive saturation,
it was with no little difficulty this
portion of the journey was performed. However,
they reached the shepherd's hut; and
unburdening their horses, they hobbled them
and turned them out to graze, while they
camped themselves for the night.</p>

<p>The hut, where they made their halt, was
on a par with others of the same pretensions,
though in no way superior. It was built of
slabs split from the log, and freely ventilated
on all sides; though in the roof, which was
covered with bark, it was perfectly impervious
to the weather. The internal arrangements, as
might be expected, were as rough as the
building itself; against the wall, in each side
of the hut, were roughly put up, with battens
and saplings, two clumsy-looking receptacles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
containing the blankets, and intended for the
nocturnal tenancy of the two occupants of the
habitation. A box belonging to one of the
men, and a rough bench built against the
other unoccupied wall, and serving for a table,
an iron pot for boiling meat, two tin quart
pots in which to make their tea, two pint
ones and dishes of the same metal, a two-gallon
keg containing water, and which in an
inverted position at times had to do duty as
a stool, and two suspended bags containing
tea and sugar, completed the furniture of the
place. In front of the door a large log had
been rolled, and was burning with lively force,
emitting a lurid glare on the surrounding
group; while on its end untouched by the
fire, sat the hut-keeper, with his companion
standing near him, and their visitors stretched
on the ground awaiting the completion of the
culinary operations of Bob Smithers' man.</p>

<p>The position of these guardians of the fleece
is usually monotonous and dreary in the extreme;
and those located here were a fair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
sample of the general herd. There was a
shepherd and a hut-keeper. The duty of the
former was to lead out the flocks daily at
dawn, to follow and tend them while depasturing,
and protect them from the depredations
of the blacks, or the molestations of
the native dogs; for which purpose in very
remote districts, such as this, they are provided
with guns. The hut-keeper, on the
other hand, remains all day at the hut, resting
from his vigils and preparing the meals of
himself and coadjutor, in readiness for the
latter's return at dusk with his charge; which
are forthwith penned and handed over to the
safe keeping of the other, who watches them
during the night.</p>

<p>These men remain in this happy state of
seclusion and ignorance of the proceedings of
the world, from which they are thus (by their
voluntary act of expatriation) excluded, from
year's end to year's end; except at shearing
time, when they bring their flocks to the head
station to be shorn; and the only being with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
whom they have any intercourse, is the man
who brings them their weekly supply of
rations. When "old hands," they in general
pass their lives in a lethargic existence;
having no apparent thought of past, present,
or future; but breathe on in a dreamy obliviousness,
until at the expiration of perhaps one
or two years, their wages having accumulated
to an amount somewhat considerable, they
leave their employment to proceed to the
nearest public-house and plunge into a course
of drinking. After the endurance of a week's
delirium, madness, and unconsciousness, they
generally find themselves, when robbed of the
greater portion of their hard-got earnings,
thrust upon the world penniless, wretched,
dispirited, and sick, to seek employment and
re-enact the same scenes of solitary penance
and wild debauchery.</p>

<p>It is true the denizens of these out-stations
are not always such characters; occasionally
"fresh arrivals," or as they are called "new
chums," may be hired by the squatter's agents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
in town and sent up to the station, whence
they are frequently removed to these outposts;
but when such is the case, they are
generally of a more sociable disposition, and
take an early opportunity of being removed
to the comfort and social intercourse of the
head station. Though in this removal they
entail more constant and arduous occupation,
they willingly embrace the labour, and leave
the indolence of their vacated posts, to be
enjoyed by some "old hand" whose mind has
been broken by the depressing influence of
constant punishment, and whose hopes have
been blighted by a constant penal servitude.
As this class of men is happily disappearing
from the country, and giving place to steady
and persevering immigrants, the charge of an
out-station, when not in the hands of one with
the old leaven of improvidence unexterminated,
necessarily becomes the probationary lot of a
"new chum."</p>

<p>The two men, with whom our travellers
found themselves located, were something of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the first mentioned class; and, to give our
readers some idea of their characters, we will
venture to encroach upon their patience, by
recounting an epitome of the conversation
that was started after the evening repast.</p>

<p>"Have you been long in this part of the
country?" asked John of the shepherd.</p>

<p>"Why no, sir, I ain't been so very long,"
replied the man; "I've got about three
months to make up my year with Mr. Smithers.
I came over from New England, and agreed
for twelve months, and I like this country far
better than the south, it ain't so cold nor so
wet."</p>

<p>"Then, I suppose, you will retain your
place, and renew your engagement when your
year is up?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, sir, I don't exactly know
about that 'ere; after being up in the bush
a while one likes to get down the country a
bit, just to see what's going on, and to spend
one's money."</p>

<p>"But, my good man, what necessity is there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
for you to go away from the station? If you
want to see any change, I've no doubt Mr.
Smithers would find you employment at the
head station; and you might allow your wages
to accumulate, until you had sufficient to
purchase some sheep of your own."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that, sir; I expect it
would be a precious long time before I would
have enough to buy a flock of sheep: and
besides, if I had any, I wouldn't know what
to do with them; I shouldn't be allowed to
graze 'em on other folk's runs; and, after
slaving away for I don't know how long, I
reckon I should just be swindled out of 'em
in the end, and be as poor and 'miserable as
a bandicoot' after all: besides, I'd rather
not have the bother with them, but just
have my spree, and 'knock down my pile,'
as usual."</p>

<p>"But, my good fellow, if you were possessed
of a flock of sheep, you could, by paying a
rent, be allowed to depasture it on some
squatter's run; and as to being swindled out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of your property, the law of the land would
protect you from that."</p>

<p>"I don't know nothing about the law of
the land, sir; but I know as how a mate of
mine, who served with a master on the Barwan
for five years, and was paid his wages in
sheep, took his flock to a piece of country he
had bought from his master and set his self
up. He hadn't been at that game though for
more nor two years, when a flood on the
river took off half his sheep, and his old master
brought him in a bill for some hundreds of
pounds for stores and things my mate had
got, and he wanted to be paid right off. Now,
my mate couldn't pay him; so he had to give
him up his sheep and go shepherding again.
So you see, sir, I may just as well spend my
money when I get it, as let myself be cheated
out of it at the end."</p>

<p>"Your friend's case was certainly a hard
one, but he seemed to be the victim of misfortune
more than of an exacting master; but
that does not show, because he did not succeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
that you or any other industrious man should
fail. Take my advice and try it; refrain from
taking your wages, let them accumulate in the
hands of your employer, and when they have
reached such a sum as to be of service to you,
ask him to invest it, and I am sure you will
have no cause to complain; besides, remember
as you get old, if you have no friends to care
for you and you are destitute as you are now,
you will starve."</p>

<p>"That's just it, you see, sir; if I go to save
money now (but I know I can't, for I never
could), if I dies I've got no one to give it to.
I've got no friends, leastwise I don't know of
none; and I am sure when I knew there was
something coming to me, I would want to
spend it; while as long as I live, I can always
earn enough to keep me."</p>

<p>"But you say you've never attempted to
save your wages; you cannot tell how you may
be influenced until you make the attempt."</p>

<p>"There is no use of my trying, sir, I am
sure I never could; and I may just take my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
money when it is due me, and have my
spree."</p>

<p>"I can't understand how it is you persist
in being so prodigal. What extraordinary
influence is it that induces you to spend your
earnings as soon as you get them?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know, sir, unless it is we get
'em too seldom. You see, when we work for
a year and don't get no money perhaps all
that time, when we do have our wages all in
a lump, it seems such a lot we don't think
how hard it cost us to get it; and we don't
know what to do with it, so we just spend it.
If we got paid, you see, as people down in the
towns, at the end of the week, and had to
keep ourselves, we might get into the way
for saving a little now and then; but as it is,
we never know how to do it, and I expect we
never shall. You see we ain't like those
fellows who let their old women look after
their money, who tell 'em it is all gone, while
all the time they've got it put away in their
old stocking."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>"Well, why don't you get married, and have
an old woman, as you call it; and by her
means you may make yourself more happy,
and be enabled, after a time, to become your
own master?"</p>

<p>"I've often thought I wouldn't mind that
sort o' thing, sir; but where do you think I
would get a young woman as'd look at the
likes of me? When they comes out to this
country, specially when they gets up here
into the bush, they're so mighty saucy, they
cocks up their noses at fellers likes us; and
besides, you know masters don't care to have
men with what they calls 'incumberances.'"</p>

<p>"No doubt there is some truth in that; but
if you by your thriftiness can possess yourself
of a little money, and be in a position to
establish yourself, you'd have no difficulty, I
should say, in inducing some industrious girl
to accept you; take my advice now, and try."</p>

<p>"All right, sir, I will," replied the man;
after which the conversation took another
turn, and the party very shortly separated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>As they were leaving the fire, Bob Smithers
remarked to John that all his advice to the
man would be lost in five minutes. He told
him it was impossible to instil prudence into
the minds of such; "their whole enjoyment,"
he said, "is in having their spree. They perceive
no pleasure in hoarding money to
provide comforts in their old age; the very
thought of it is distasteful to them, and as to
that fellow (pointing to the man John had
been conversing with), if he succeeded in passing
the year without drawing his wages, some
of his mates would tell him he was a fool; and
thinking so himself, he would not rest until
he had been paid and gone through his course
of drunkenness."</p>

<p>"I am aware," said John, "such is his present
feeling; and I have met with many like
him, but have succeeded in persuading, not a
few, to practise a life of frugality; and I am
convinced, with a little admonition, that that
man could be induced to adopt a similar
course."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>"Well, perhaps, he could," replied Smithers;
"but, for my part, if those fellows feel inclined
to spend their money foolishly, I don't think
it is our interest to prevent them. If we
induced all the men in the country to save
their wages, or take them in sheep, we would
have the colony overrun with a set of "stringy
bark squatters," who would be so infesting
our lands that our runs would be cut up
into innumerable small parts, just to serve
vagabonds."</p>

<p>"You must admit," replied John, "that if
a provident spirit were to be infused into the
people, it would be the means of stocking the
country by an industrious and thrifty population;
and be far more beneficial to the
colony than allowing the lands to remain in
the hands of a few wealthy squatters."</p>

<p>"Oh, pooh! pooh!" cried Smithers; "but
I'm not going to argue with you; we had
better start in the morning soon after daylight;
so, now, let's take a snooze." With this
the young men entered the hut, and, rolling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
themselves in their blankets, settled for sleep;
which they enjoyed uninterruptedly until an
early hour in morning. They then arose; and,
after taking a matin ablution in the creek,
returned to the hut to partake of their breakfast,
which was being prepared by Joey; while
Bob Smithers' stock-man brought in the
horses.</p>

<p>It may, no doubt, appear strange to the
reader that horses should be turned out loose
in the bush, with only the simple precaution
of "hobbling" their fore-feet, without the
danger of the animals being lost to their
owners; but such is rarely to be apprehended,
except in the case of some incorrigible beasts
who are not to be trusted. We certainly have
known horses, so hobbled, make off in a sort of
shambling gallop, by drawing up the two confined
feet together, and progressing in short
leaps; but, in general, a horse so turned out at
night, after a day's hard ride, has a sort of tacit
understanding with his master that he is to be
at hand when required: or at least his natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
instinct prompts him to make the most use of
his leisure time, and occupy the period of his
release in diligently administering to his own
wants, and satisfying the calls of hunger and
exhausted nature; and if searched for at daybreak,
before having had time to wander, he is
generally found in a convenient proximity to
"the camp." Such was the case in the present
instance.</p>

<p>When the horses were saddled and ready
for a start, the party mounted, and the cavalcade
moved off. The country they intended
to visit was situated on the main river, some
considerable distance further down its course;
but, owing to the numerous creeks that
mingled their waters with the main stream, it
was impossible for them to follow the bank of
the river without meeting with many interruptions
and impediments. They therefore
traced up the creek; and, by means of their
compass, they shaped their course so as to
either head all the creeks, or so far reach their
sources, as to be enabled to cross them with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>out
difficulty. This circuitous route necessarily
occupied more time than what would
have been required under more auspicious
circumstances; and the still heavy nature of
the ground, from its late pluvial visitation,
rendered the journey extremely tedious; while
it prevented them from reaching Strawberry
Hill, the only station on the river below
Brompton, that night. This run had been
sold to the present occupants by Bob Smithers,
and had been taken possession of by them
some eighteen months previously. It had
been Smithers' intention to have made this
place their quarters for that night; but finding
it could not be reached before dark, and there
being situated in the line a deep and awkward
river called the Wombi, running into
the Gibson, and for which he preferred daylight
to cross, he determined to keep higher
up the Wombi, and camp on its bank where
the country was open and flat.</p>

<p>Arriving at the "Dingo plains," a place so
named from the number of those animals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
which frequented it, they halted for the night,
intending to camp and cross the river in the
morning. They would thus, by making this
detour, keep high above Strawberry Hill; and
Smithers therefore purposed taking his companions
round the back and lower boundaries
<a name="of" id="of"></a><ins title="original had fo">of</ins> the run they wished to see; thence through
its extent to its other extreme on the Gibson
river; making occasional deviations to the
principal water courses and eminences, from
which a good view of the country could be
obtained; and thence to return. Smoking
their pipes over their fire, Bob detailed these
plans to the young men, who perfectly agreed
with their judiciousness, and determined to
put them in practice on the following day.
They then fell into a desultory conversation;
through which we will not trouble the reader
by following; but merely remark that it was
principally upon the occupants of the station
on the river, the character of the blacks in the
neighbourhood, and the likelihood of annoyance
from the dingos. That these latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
were numerous it was pretty evident; for the
travellers more than once had intimation, of a
close proximity to their camp, of a tribe of
those canine aborignals, who prefer the enjoyment
of a pristine independence to the blessings
of civilisation, except in so far as that
civilisation can be made subservient to their
comfort and sustenance.</p>

<p>The dingo, or as it is generally called, the
native dog, occupies in the social scale, much
the same position in the southern hemisphere,
as the fox does in the northern; and also
approaches more nearly to that animal in
semblance and character than any other
known. Its colour is generally of a dark
sandy or reddish brown, with hair rather long,
a bushy low-hanging tail, long ears, which
except while being pursued he usually keeps
erect, pointed snout, and sharp piercing eyes.
He is stupid and cowardly; generally creeping
along with a slinking gait to surprise
his prey, which he usually siezes by the
throat. He is easily frightened, and deterred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
from his purpose by the simplest contrivances;
and is quite devoid of that cunning which
characterizes his antipodean prototype. His
course of destruction has been known to
be arrested by an ordinary four-wire fence,
through which he could have easily passed;
though he sat on the exterior of the enclosure,
moaning piteously at the flock within; while
his mental obtuseness failed to percieve a
means of ingress. To sheep he is most destructive;
and if a flock is so carelessly
tended as to admit of his insinuating himself,
the havoc he makes is frightful: for not
content with fastening on one, he will snap,
tear, worry, and mangle possibly half the flock;
and passing from one to another, with the
rapidity of thought, the mortality that results
from his visit is truly disastrous. He never
barks like a domesticated dog, but yelps and
howls; and at night when he sounds his note,
it is taken up by the entire pack, and made
to resound with a mournful cadence over the
face of the country. As they sit on their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
haunches, with their noses extended in an
elevation to the sky, chorusing their lachrymose
and supplicatory lamentations, the
effect is one of the most dismal that can be
conceived.</p>

<p>To society such as this the young men
had a decided objection; and concluding,
that if they did not take steps to disperse
their nocturnal visitors (who treated them to
numerous appeals which were anything but
euphonic), they would stand a very poor
chance of enjoying any rest. Besides the
probability that a keen appetite might induce
the dogs to extend their favours to the horses,
it was also a matter of prudence to insist upon
their removing themselves to some more
distant location; and to support this with
a forcible argument, the travellers got their
guns in readiness, and moved away in silence
into the darkness.</p>

<p>Our friends were not left long to ascertain
in what direction to expect a recontre, for a
fresh eructation of the metrical whine gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
them sufficient notice. The black boy soon
descried the disturbers of their peace by the
glitter of a host of canine optics, and directed
his masters and their friend where to fire.
This they did; and the effect of their shots
was instantly apparent, from the excessive
yelping that greeted their ears, and satisfied
them that some, at least, of their annoyers
had got something to remember; while they
were gratified to listen to the fast receding
sounds of these "mercurial inhabitants of the
plain." The dogs quickly "made themselves
scarce," nor did they afterwards attempt to
reduce the distance they had placed between
themselves and the travellers; who, upon the
establishment of quiet, and after supplying
fresh material to their fire, nestled themselves
in their blankets around the cheerful
blaze, and stretched themselves to sleep under
the "starlit canopy of heaven."</p>

<p>Early on the next morning the journey was
resumed; and for three days, with very little
variety, they traversed the run, of which we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
need say nothing; except that the country
answered the expectations of the Fergusons,
who were pleased with its appearance, and
returned with Bob Smithers to complete the
purchase at Brompton. Here preliminaries
were soon effected. Mr. Ferguson's agents in
Sydney had been instructed by him to honour
any drafts drawn by his son, and to transact
any business he might require; therefore
John at once drew upon them for the amount
of this purchase, and placed himself in communication
respecting the other arrangements;
forwarding the note of sale from Smithers,
and an obligation from him to sign the
necessary deeds of transfer when they were
ready for execution. He then took his leave
of the family, intending to go down to
Moreton Bay, whence a steamer plied to
Sydney, and on thence to superintend his
business there and select the necessaries for
forming the station; at the same time that
his brother and Joey returned to New England,
to wait there until John had so far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
perfected his plans, as to be able to bring up
his supplies and prepare the station for the
reception of the sheep.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to trace the peregrinations
of John Ferguson, or to tire the reader with a
detail of William's every day life at Acacia
creek; we will simply say that in the course
of about six weeks John returned to
Brisbane, and wrote to his brother to muster
their sheep and start with them for the station
as soon as possible. He stated that he had
engaged drays to take up their loading, and
that he intended to precede them himself;
so that he would in all probability reach the
station some weeks before either the supplies
or the sheep, and would engage some bush
carpenters as he went up, to prepare the
place for their reception. To carry out this
intention, he made all speed for his destination;
and arriving at Alma, the nearest township to
his place, on the fourth day, he there engaged
two men, to whom he gave directions to meet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
him at Brompton, and pushed on himself for
that station.</p>

<p>Alma and Brompton lay about equidistant
from his own place; but his inability to describe
sufficiently clearly to the understanding
of the men the <i>locale</i> of the new station, and
his rations having been left at the latter place,
it was necessary for him to proceed there first.
Upon his appearance at Mr. Smithers', he was
welcomed with much cordiality; and every
assistance was given him by the kind proprietor,
though he had been quite disinterested
in the arrangements between Bob and the
Fergusons. Yet such was his kindly disposition,
that considerations of interest weighed
very little with him, and he freely and kindly
tendered any aid that lay in his power. He
recommended John to go over to the run, and,
if he had not done so already, to select a
site for his station; and for that purpose he
offered him the services of one of his own
men; while he promised to have the carpenters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
directed to the place whenever they made
their appearance.</p>

<p>The run had been originally called Fern
Vale by Bob Smithers, when he tendered for
it to the government; and John Ferguson,
who thought he could not improve upon it,
had allowed it to retain that name. The part
of it which had attracted Bob's attention, and
induced him to so christen it, was a gently
undulating valley opening to the Gibson river,
as the crow flies, a few miles below Strawberry
Hill. The north side of the valley was
partially covered with the fern plant (which
suggested the name); and here, it struck John,
would be a good site for his station, and he
consequently determined to visit it first.</p>

<p>On the following morning, in company with
the man, whose assistance had been so kindly
given him by Mr. Smithers, John rode over to
the run, and reaching the valley we have mentioned
camped for the night. In the morning,
at the first sight of his position, he was convinced
no better situation could be found; so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
gave up the idea of any further prospecting,
and prepared for the carpenters, by marking
out the sites for the house, huts, and yards.</p>

<p>Down the valley, which we have said opened
out to the river, meandered a beautiful little
limpid stream; on the upper side of the vale,
and receding from the banks of the river, rose
a gentle acclivity, which pointed itself out as
the spot on which to erect the house; while
on the flat below was every convenience for
the huts and yards. Above this point the
river took a considerable bend, making on
the other side a deep pocket, which was low
and apparently subject to flooding. It was
covered by a dense scrub, over which, from
the elevated position John had chosen for
his domicile, he could catch a glimpse of
Strawberry Hill; which, though on the same
side of the river as Fern Vale, and some distance
round, appeared, when looking across
the head of the stream, not very far off.</p>

<p>The carpenters shortly making their appearance,
all were soon in a state of animation; and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
before long, the crash of falling timber, the
echo of the axe in felling, and the mallet in
splitting the logs for the fences, resounded
through the wood, where hitherto solitude had
held undisputed sway; and, long before the
arrival of the flocks or the supplies, substantial
stock-yards had been erected, as well as huts
for the shepherds, and a commodious store-house.
The construction of the dwelling-house,
being a matter of a secondary consideration,
it was necessarily left to the last; and
the whole party set to work busily to put up a
large shed for shearing, and storing the wool
when ready for packing.</p>

<p>When William Ferguson received his
brother's letter, he immediately collected the
draft of sheep with which they were to commence
their station, and started with them
for Fern Vale, in company with Joey and two
shepherds. The route he intended to adopt,
in his migration, was somewhat the same as
that taken by his brother and himself on their
first journey to Brompton. He was induced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
to make choice of this, partly to enable him to
renew the acquaintance of Mr. Dawson; but
principally on account of its leading him
through a part of the country little frequented,
by which he would be enabled to prosecute
his journey with less chance of molestation.
He therefore communicated his intention to
Mr. Dawson by post, which (though taking a
more circuitous route than he) would reach
Barra Warra long before he made his appearance
with his flock. With a large number of
sheep in charge, the travelling was necessarily
slow and tedious; and some time had been
consumed ere the young man approached the
station of his acquaintance. No circumstance
worth recording had marked the passage thus
far; all things seemed propitious; and as
William left his sheep in the charge of his
employees, encamped within sight of Barra
Warra, he felt certain of a successful termination
to his journey.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the house of Mr. Dawson, he
was disappointed to find that gentleman from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
home (having been suddenly called away to
town on business); though he left word with
his good lady, to express his regrets at the
circumstance that prevented his having the
pleasure of meeting his young friend, and his
hope that William would make Barra Warra
his resting-place as long as he could conveniently
do so. Mrs. Dawson expressed her
happiness to see him, and also pressed her
husband's invitation; while the children, who
speedily remembered him, uttered their welcomes
in tones of joyous gratulation.</p>

<p>William thanked the kind-hearted lady, and
accepted the invitation with pleasure; though
the visit, he said, would necessarily be short,
as he required to urge on the sheep, and he did
not like resigning the responsibility to either
of the men. He was sorry, he said, that his
visits hitherto had been such flying ones; but
promised to make amends at an early opportunity,
when he anticipated he would be under
the necessity of craving the hospitality of
Barra Warra for his sister; who purposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
joining her brothers when their station was
made a little comfortable. The bare proposition
quite delighted Mrs. Dawson, who was
warm in her expressions of approval; and said
she would be charmed to make the acquaintance
of Miss Ferguson, and hoped she would
have more sociability than her brothers, and
not require so much pressing to induce a visit
from her.</p>

<p>William assured his friend, that his sister
would reciprocate the delight; for she had
already, he said, expressed a desire to know
Mrs. Dawson, from simply hearing him mention
her name.</p>

<p>We need not trace the conversation through
all its minuti&aelig;, nor delay our narrative by
detailing the further progress of William
Ferguson; but simply mention, that on the
following morning he proceeded on his journey,
while we turn to view the movements of his
brother.</p>

<p>In the meantime, John had got all his buildings
so far completed, as to have them ready<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
for the settlement of the station as soon as the
flocks and the drays with the supplies should
have arrived. It was not his intention to build
the house until they settled themselves, and
got some little leisure after shearing time; and,
until then, he proposed living with his brother
in one of the huts erected for the men. He
now looked anxiously for the drays; and as the
weather had been fine since they started, and
they had been a good time on the road, he believed
they could not be far distant; especially
as he had received intimation from Mr. Smithers
that a man had arrived at Brompton, who
had passed them the day before he reached
that station. He therefore thought it advisable
to leave the carpenters at work on a few
odds and ends that still required doing, and
proceed along the road to meet the drays, and
hurry them on to their destination. He did so;
and some few miles past Strawberry Hill he
descried the lumbering vehicles jogging on at
their (or rather the bullocks') leisure; and he
turned with them, in company, until they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
reached the crossing-place of the Wombi. The
appearance of this spot did not, by any means,
favourably prepossess the minds of the bullock-drivers:
the banks were of black alluvial soil,
and had a steep descent to the water; which,
though reduced to its ordinary level, looked
black from the colour of the banks and the
soil through which it passed; and had an
appearance of depth, not at all inviting to
drivers of heavily-laden drays.</p>

<p>However, cross it they were compelled to;
for there was no other place where the river
could be passed with any degree of safety,
without going considerably farther; so, after
directing John to go over with his horse, that
he might see what he had to encounter, the
first bullock-driver urged his team down the
slope and into the water, where it splashed
and floundered on until it succeeded in
bringing the dray about half way across.
There the bottom was so soft, and the dray
wheels had become so embedded in the mud,
that only with the assistance of the second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
team could the passage be effected. The
second dray was not even so fortunate as the
first; for all efforts of the double team were
unavailing to pass the rubicon; and it settled
in the mud mid-way between the banks.
Adding to this, the fact that the water was
already above the axle, and consequently
damaging the loading; and that in all probability,
if not speedily extricated, the dray
would become even more immovable; it was
evident, to the men, some strenuous efforts
were required to overcome the difficulty.</p>

<p>The Australian bullock dray with its bovine
traction, we may remark, is without exception
the most primitive means of conveyance that
can either be devised or imagined. The ponderous
vehicle, in perfect keeping with the
heavy and drowsy quadrupeds who draw it at
a snail-like pace, stands prominently forth as
a reproach to the inventive genius of man;
and, excepting perhaps the substitute of iron
in coupling and linking the animals, and in
some parts of the vehicular construction, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
whole equipage possesses not the shadow of
an improvement on the popular conveyances
of the age of Sesostris. But in this sunny
land, settlers are content with the questionable
facilities of transit offered by these primeval
means; while they console themselves with
the belief that no other style of vehicle would
stand the wear and tear of being drawn over
logs and stumps of trees, rocks and precipices,
and through rivers and swamps; and that no
other animal but the patient bullock, could
endure the fatigue and privation of alternate
heat, wet, hunger and thirst, and a constant
taxation of strength and resignation. 'Tis true,
at times, the obstacles to travelling are almost
insuperable, and that the roads have no title
to the dignity of such a name; being, in most
instances, merely tracks formed by the drays
following the course of a predecessor; but still,
no attempt even is made to improve the means
of conveyance. The settlers content themselves
with the existence of things that be, and
are satisfied with the progressive rate of from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
fifteen to twenty miles a day; at which speed
a team of ten bullocks, in fine weather, will
draw a dray with thirty to forty hundred-weight;
while during wet, they may not perform
the same distance in a week.</p>

<p>The individuals who manage the guidance
of these machines, and who are generally
accompanied by an assistant, are too often
some of the most reprobate members of the
family of man. Their sole accomplishments
are the management of their drays; the
forcible appeals to their bullocks, made by the
application of their long whips (upon the
expertness in the use of which they pride
themselves); the facile utterance of their
blaspheming interjections; and their ability
to plunder without detection. The <i>acme</i> of
their human felicity is perpetual intoxication;
and to gratify this propensity, they have no
scruples in assisting themselves to any liquor
which they may be entrusted to carry;
frequently adopting ingenious plans to abstract
it from the bulk, and replace it by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
water in such a way as to defy detection.
They are ignorant in the extreme, and though
assumed to be civilised and sentient beings,
their vices render them, in the scale of
humanity, on a par with the aboriginal blacks;
individuals of whom, frequently follow in their
train, and, until debased by their vile influence,
by far their superiors in an ethical point of
view.</p>

<p>In stimulating the propulsion of his team,
the bullock-driver addresses each of his beasts
by name; such as, "eh, Smiler;" "come up,
Strawberry;" "Cap-tain," etc.; accompanying
every admonition with a profusion of oaths,
and a wholesale application of the lash. If
remonstrated with for his use of so ungenteel
a vocabulary, he will endeavour, with considerable
earnestness, to convince you that the
bullocks perfectly understand what is said to
them; and that they are so wayward in their
disposition, that nothing short of such determined
and forcible language is of any avail.
He will support his arguments with many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
stories of the wonderful instinct and percipiency
displayed by his animals; all of
which stories, though exceedingly marvellous,
obtain implicit credence in the mind of the
narrator; and only come short, in point of
hyperbolical marvel, of the wonderful utterance
of Tom Connor's cat, in the plain Anglo-Saxon
vernacular. Though we do not intend either
to support or refute the sophistry of these
men, it is only just to say, that considering
every bullock has a name, upon the utterance
of which it is made to feel an application of
the whip, it is not to be wondered at that the
animals are soon taught to recognise their
appellations, and in the expectation of chastisement,
to brighten up when they hear them.</p>

<p>The reader may imagine we have drawn too
depraved a picture of this neglected class of
men; but we solemnly affirm we have not.
There are, of course, exceptions to this, as to
every rule; for we have known many industrious,
and even respectable well-conducted
men, as bullock-drivers; but unfortunately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
they were only the exceptions: the general
mass are as corrupt and vicious as it is
possible for human beings to be. Why this
is so, we are at a loss rightly to understand;
though we imagine the primary cause is this:
Attendant on bullock-driving are many discomforts;
more, possibly, than in any other
occupation in the bush. Hence it is an employment
which industrious or enterprising
individuals generally shun; and in the successive
scales of advancement, in which the steady
immigrant effects his rise, it is left to members
of the lowest scum; who prefer the freedom
of this erratic life, to the more settled conformities
of order and society.</p>

<p>We left John Ferguson on the bank of the
river, gazing on the dray safely (or rather
unsafely) fixed in the bed of the river. The
bullock-drivers had lashed, frantically shouted,
and swore; while they performed sundry
man&oelig;uvres, and excited evolutions; to induce
the bullocks to strain an extra nerve, to extricate
the vehicle: but all to no purpose; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
efforts of the beasts were unavailing, while the
delay only rendered the case more hopeless.
In this state of things, the men perceived the
only course open to them, was to lighten the
load as much as possible, by partially unloading
the dray, and carrying the goods over the
river themselves. With this determination
they set earnestly to work, and succeeded in
removing the greater portion of the goods;
when they made another attempt, happily with
better success than previously; and brought
the dray from its miry adherence to a position
on the bank. It was then reladen with the
goods; while the men, barely recovered from
the chagrin caused by the misadventure, performed
their work with a sullen moroseness,
enlivening their gloom by animadversions on
the river, the country, and everybody connected
with their peregrination.</p>

<p>In this humour John left them to follow him,
while he proceeded to the station, where we
will also lead the reader. Upon his return to
Fern Vale, he found, during his short absence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
that the blacks, attracted by the appearance
of a fresh settlement, had congregated in some
considerable numbers; though more out of
curiosity than with any idea of aggression.
At sight of John, a number of them immediately
assembled round him; looking at him,
and everything about the place, in a sort of
inquisitive manner; jabbering amongst themselves;
and handling everything portable
within their reach. The group consisted of
some twenty persons of both sexes and various
ages; and were a family of the Nungar tribe,
which usually made its home on the other
side of the Gibson river, in the scrub, and
the mountains and broken country receding
from it.</p>

<p>The sight of this visitation did not altogether
please the young squatter, for he
thought he saw in the future considerable
annoyance from similar visits. He therefore
demanded of them what they required; and
told them, that though he had no objection to
their coming about the place so long as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
behaved themselves, if he caught them committing
any theft, or becoming in any way
troublesome, he would not allow one of them
afterwards to approach the station.</p>

<p>They seemed to understand this communication;
for one of them informed John,
that a good many of their tribe had been
employed by the squatters, to wash their
sheep, and do work about the stations, and
would be very glad to do the same for him.
Thinking possibly that it might be the means
of coming to some friendly understanding
with the tribe, and would give him a means
of acquiring some knowledge of their movements
and disposition, he thought it advisable
to take the services of some of them; more
especially as in the then rough state of the
settlement, their services could be turned to
some account. Acting on this impulse, then,
he selected two young athletic black boys; who
seemed more intelligent than the majority, and
who appeared to have a disposition to remain
on the station, and to adapt themselves to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
ways of the white man. He then distributed
some tobacco and rations amongst them, and
they took their departure apparently well
pleased.</p>

<p>By this time the drays were seen making
their approach; and great was instantly the
bustle in preparation for the reception of the
"loading." The articles which constitute a station's
"supplies" are of such a kaleidoscopic
variety, that their enumeration would almost be
endless; and we will merely observe that the
heterogeneous mass was safely, and speedily,
transferred from the dray to the ground,
whence it was deposited in the store. Various
edibles; and their condiments such as tea, sugar,
flour, oilman's stores, etc., were successively
unpacked and stowed away; and everything
appeared to be sound, until it was discovered
that the salt, which had been placed in the
bottom of the dray, was unfortunately
damaged; it had, in fact, during its submersion
in the water "dissolved," and</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="io">"Like the baseless fabric of a vision,</span>
<span class="i0">Left not a rack behind."</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>Such events as this are of frequent occurrence;
and, where the opportunities of procuring
supplies are very rare, severe are the straits,
and numerous the inconveniences, to which
residents in the interior are subjected. After
long and continued wet or dry weather, when
travelling is rendered difficult or impossible,
from the country being impassable by floods,
or impracticable from drought and absence of
feed, settlers in the remote districts are often
reduced to states bordering on absolute starvation,
or at least to a subsistence on meat,
without any concomitant "fixins." When
such cases occur, which we are happy to say is
seldom, the squatters lend to one another the
articles most in demand, until they either all
become destitute of provisions, or are relieved
by the receipt of a fresh supply. But articles
that are not in every day consumption, and
not considered of paramount importance, they
are frequently compelled to do without for
months; and so accustomed do they become to
this species of self-denial, that the absence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
many things is thought very little of. Salt,
however, is an article indispensable on a
station; for the greater portion of the meat
consumed is required to be salted, to preserve
it in the hot weather; while it is also frequently
necessary, on some stations, to supply it to the
sheep and cattle. For this purpose, rock salt
is usually provided; but, in its absence, the
ordinary coarse salt is put into small canvas
bags, and suspended from trees, that the cattle
may satisfy their saline cravings by licking
the moisture, which, from the nightly dews
and the natural dampness of the salt, exudes
through the pores of the canvas.</p>

<p>When John saw the nature of his loss,
knowing there was no use in complaining, he
made the best of his mishap by determining
to ride over in the morning to Strawberry
Hill, and see if he could not borrow some from
his neighbour there until the receipt of his
further supplies for shearing. Before going,
however, on the following morning, he desired
to settle with the bullock-driver for the car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>riage
of his supplies up, and to make arrangements
with him for the occupation of one of
his teams for the remainder of the season.
For that purpose he took his bridle in his
hand, and proceeded to catch his horse, which
was running in one of the paddocks lately
fenced in; and on the way, as he passed the
camp of the draymen, he requested the fellow
to go up to the hut in a few minutes, to be
settled with, and receive his instructions for
further employment. He then went in search
of his steed, leaving the men stretched on the
grass in front of a fire, near which stood their
pots of tea, cooling; and in the ashes of which
lay embedded their "damper," receiving its
finishing heat, preparatory to being subjected
to the operation of mastication; while the
fellows themselves lay motionless, and careless
of everything around them, in the full enjoyment
of the everlasting pipe.</p>

<p>Oh, smoke! thou deity of thousands, and
the special idol of the bush-man! thou that
soothest the dull moments of a weary solitude,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
and the anguish of a desponding spirit; that
satisfiest the cravings of a consuming hunger;
that alleviates the pains, brightens the intellects,
and dispels illusion of the morbid fancies
and diseased imaginations of thy votaries!
thou anodyne for melancholy; thou disseminator
of good feeling; conciliator and
ratifyer of peace offerings! without thee what
would mortal bush-man be?&mdash;they, to whom
thou art a friend in need. All potent smoke!
thine influence is supreme; thy virtues are
legion; and thy capabilities are boundless as
the vapour into which thou meltest as a
holocaust for thy happy devotees. If the pipe
could but speak, what mysteries could it
reveal! the rapturous visions of the inspired
lover, rising in the circular imageries of its
vaporous fumes, to beguile his fancies in the
absence of his loved one; or the workings of a
deep despondency and bitter disappointment,
carrying its victim with blind impetuosity to
a melancholy contemplation of a drear destruction,
until the spirit seizes with avidity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the proffered consolation, and the phantasmia
vanishes under thy narcotic influence. The
miseries of an insatiable thirst, and the sufferings
of a gnawing hunger, fatigue, and indisposition,
are all forgotten during the enjoyment
of a smoke; while in a dilemma, or
danger, in a deluging discomfort, or the
anxieties consequent on being lost in the bush,
the pipe is the ever ready comforter; and one
which rarely fails to bring consolation to the
mind. Well, therefore, may it be imagined
that the pipe is "the friend of the people;" and
that, not only of the canaille, the "great unwashed,"
but the entire nation; who in this
day of general enlightenment and mental percipiency,
have not failed to distinguish its
claims, and to "render homage where homage
is due." Many are the shifts, and crude the
inventions in the bush, when emergencies call
forth the application of the old proverb respecting
the relationship that exists between
destitution and genius; and when to be minus
the support of the Virginian weed, is con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>sidered
a greater misfortune than to be
wanting of the necessaries of life. Hence,
when requested by John Ferguson to go up to
the hut, the draymen had not the remotest
intention of disturbing themselves, at least for
a time; and they continued to puff in an inert
silence, while they contemplated the flames
before them, and ejected an occasional expectoration,
at an imaginary pandemonium in the
embers.</p>

<p>They had remained in this state of <i>statu
quo</i> for some time, when John Ferguson, who
had caught his horse, and returned to the hut,
not finding the men there, came down to
where they lay. He then addressed himself
to the still recumbent driver, and requested
that he would come up with him and be
settled with, and arrange for further loading.
The independent carrier did eventually condescend
to rise, and he slowly bent his steps
to the station, accompanied by John, who
gave him by the way a sketch of his plans.
He wished him to start at once with his dray<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
for Alma, and to bring back a quantity of
shingles, window frames, and doors (for
which, he told him, he would give him an
order to a store-keeper there, who kept a
supply of them); and then to return immediately,
as the things were necessary for
the construction of his house. The carpenters,
whom he had on the station, were to
employ themselves in cutting the timber and
planks required in the erection; which they
were to proceed with, anticipating the return
of the dray; by which time John expected to
be ready for shearing, and would be able to
give it a load of wool to take down to the
port for shipment. They walked on in this
way for some little distance, Ferguson absorbed
in his conversation with the bullock-driver,
and paying little attention to his path; while
the latter listened to his directions, seemingly
without noticing his remarks, beyond an
occasional grunt of acquiescence, and with
his eyes fixed upon the ground.</p>

<p>A tributary (or rather the bed of what after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
heavy rains formed a tributary) of the creek,
though now almost dry, here crossed their
path. At some remote age a large tree had
fallen across the stream, and, having buried
itself in the soil on either side, formed a
barrier to the current; which had in the
course of years left a deposit of earth and
sand, so as to bring its bed above the impediment
on a level with the obstruction; while, on
the lower side of the log, the bank of sand and
pebbles had been hollowed out into a pool by
the eddying of a miniature cataract. Though
the creek was otherwise dry, in this pool there
was water; and John Ferguson, walking along
the course with his companion, and leading
his horse after him by the bridle, made a short
bound to clear the water-hole. He, however,
was prevented from effecting his purpose, by
the bullock-driver, who, at the moment of his
leap, seized him by the arm, and caused him
to alight, instead of on the bank, in the middle
of the water; where he stood up to his knees,
with a look at his companion of enquiring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
astonishment. The man, hardly able to
refrain from indulging in a positive fit of
stentorian cachinnation, without deigning any
auricular explanation, pointed to the bank, on
which Ferguson felt annoyed for not being
permitted to reach. He instantly directed
his eyes to the spot indicated by his companion,
and at once perceived the nature of
the escape he had made; for there had lain a
large brown snake, on which he would have
inevitably trodden, the consequences of which
made him shudder to contemplate. Being
aroused from its torpor by the approach and
close proximity of those, whom its instinct
told it were enemies, the reptile raised its
head and about two feet of its body
in a perpendicular attitude, with the head
slightly extended and swaying from side to
side; while it protruded its long forked tongue
in fitful starts, and expressed a combination
of fear and venomous hate in loud hisses.
John felt his position, as the beast in a tortuous
course slowly curled its body towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
him, as being anything but pleasant; and
being only armed with an ordinary riding-whip,
considered that, if discretion was not
the better part of valour, it was certainly
more conducive to his safety.</p>

<p>With this belief, and with his eyes fixed
upon the reptile, he made a retrograde movement
to extricate himself from the unpleasantness
of at least his damp location; but he
was not a little surprised to find the snake
approaching still nearer to him. This puzzled
him exceedingly; he could not understand
the idea of a snake attacking a man, when
there was a chance open for it to escape;
such a thing he had never heard of, and had
hitherto believed it never to have occurred.
But such in this instance was evidently (he
thought) the intention of his opponent, or
why should it continue to diminish the distance
between him and itself. If John did
not witness this diminution with alarm, he at
least desired to be better supplied with defence,
and shouted to his companion to procure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
a stout stick. Obtaining no reply, he cast a
hasty glance over his shoulder, to see what
had become of the man; when the snake, taking
advantage of the momentary withdrawal
of his eyes, made a rapid movement towards
him. This John instantly perceived, and believing
the reptile was determined to attack
him, "he joined issue" at once, and gave a
furious cut at it with his whip. The brute,
however, evaded the blow, and once more
erected itself in front of Ferguson, hissing its
malevolence almost in his very face. This
movement decided its fate, for with a motion
as quick as thought he gave another cut with
his whip; which, with a whiz that discomposed
the nerves of his horse, encircled with its
supple thong the extended neck of the reptile,
and terminated its existence by dislocation. He
then effected another fulfilment of the prognosticated
command of an inscrutable divinity,
by crushing its head under his heel; when he
was joined by his companion, who had been
searching for a weapon to aid in the strife.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
The snake thus destroyed was of the brown
species, and deadly venomous; it measured
about six feet, and, if it had been trodden
upon by John Ferguson, would have in all
human probability saved us from the further
pursuit of this narrative. Its pertinacity in
approaching to its destruction, we may state,
was owing to the fact of John preventing it
from reaching its hole; which they now discovered
under the log, and close to where he
had stood. The couple now pursued their
course, and after arriving at the huts and settling
with the drayman for the work he had
already performed, and giving him an order
to the store-keeper in Alma, with the necessary
instructions, John took his departure for
Strawberry Hill.</p>

<p>"I believe I have the pleasure of addressing
Mr. Rainsfield," said John Ferguson, as he rode
up to a gentleman at Strawberry Hill, who
by his appearance indicated himself as the
proprietor of the station.</p>

<p>"That is my name," replied he addressed;
"and I presume I have the honour of meeting
Mr. Ferguson?"</p>

<p>John acknowledging to his appellation, dismounted
from his horse, and shaking hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
with his newly-made acquaintance, the latter
remarked: "I have to apologize, Mr. Ferguson,
for not making my respects to you before; but
you will pardon me, when I tell you I have
been away from the station for some little
time, and it was only yesterday when I returned,
that my people told me of your settlement.
However, I am happy that you have
anticipated me in this visit; and if you are
not in any very particular hurry, let one of my
fellows put your horse in the stable, and just
step into the house, that I may introduce you
to the folks inside. They will be delighted, I
am sure, that you have favoured us by introducing
yourself;" saying which, he called one
of the boys about the place to look after
John's steed, while he led its owner to the
dwelling. Of the mansion itself we need say
nothing: it was simply a weather-boarded
verandah cottage; the like of which is to be
met with so frequently in the bush, as to give
the idea of their being built to an universal
plan; it was neat, and apparently comfortable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>When John Ferguson entered with Mr.
Rainsfield he was ushered at once into the
sitting-room; where, at the table, sat two
ladies busily employed on some description of
needlework, whose destined use was a mystery
to the uninitiated. On the table before them,
and at their feet, were strewn their necessary
paraphernalia; and so busily engaged were they
at their occupation, that they were not aware
of the presence of any one besides themselves,
until Mr. Rainsfield gave them notice of
the fact by remarking, "Mr. Ferguson has
waived all ceremony, my dear, and called upon
us to make himself known, and commence a
friendship, which I trust will remain uninterrupted."</p>

<p>The ladies then rose, and were introduced
to John, as "Mrs. Rainsfield, my wife," and
"Miss Rainsfield, my cousin;" and both expressed
to our hero their welcomes and delight,
that they had been so fortunate as to secure
friendly and companionable neighbours. Mrs.
Rainsfield at once gave a <i>carte blanche</i> to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
young man and his brother; and stated that
she hoped she would see as much of them at
Strawberry Hill as their time would admit, and
trusted that their society would be a mutual
enjoyment.</p>

<p>John expressed himself highly flattered
with his kind reception and invitations; and
in the name of his brother and himself,
promised to avail himself frequently of their
hospitality, from which he anticipated much
pleasure. But leaving them to continue their
conversation without interruption, we will,
with the indulgence of the reader, describe the
several members of the Rainsfield family.</p>

<p>Mr. John Rainsfield, the proprietor of the station,
was a gentleman of about two-and-thirty
years of age; his appearance was what might be
called gentlemanly; though, while being perhaps
prepossesing, having nothing about it to
attract any particular attention. In his disposition
he was thought to be morose; though it
was not indicative of a confirmed ill-temper, but
arose from a reserve occasioned by a distaste for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
the popular practices of his neighbours. Those
who knew him found him anything but distant,
and by his friends he was pronounced a good-hearted
fellow. It is true, on his station, he
was a strict disciplinarian, and had a mortal
enmity to the blacks; notwithstanding which
he was usually liked by his men, and rarely
had so much trouble with the aborigines as
his neighbours. His history was that of most
of his class; an emigration to the country to
better his circumstances, and a pastoral servitude
in various grades, until he had accumulated
sufficient to either take up or purchase
country, and procure a flock of sheep; which
could have been purchased at a few shillings
a-head. Thus, having once procured a start,
his success was almost certain; and, in fact, at
the time of which we write, he had firmly
established himself in a position of comfort
and respectability.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rainsfield was a lady some few years
the junior of her husband; was kind and
amiable, with a pleasing expression of coun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>tenance,
which, if not absolutely pretty, was
certainly winning, and calculated to demand
attention. The attachment between herself
and her husband had been a very early one;
and when he had left his native land to seek
his fortune in a far away home, it had been
determined that as soon as he was in a position
to support her, she should join him in
Australia. This plan had been carried out;
and after a short sojourn in the country he
had been enabled to send home for her. She
joyfully responded to his call, and upon her
arrival was united to her faithful lover. Since
their union their life had been an uninterrupted
course of domestic bliss; and they were
blessed, at the period of our narrative, with
four pledges of their happiness.</p>

<p>Eleanor Rainsfield, who, as already introduced
to the reader as Mr. Rainsfield's cousin,
was the daughter of that gentleman's deceased
uncle, who had early emigrated, with a newly-married
wife, to the colony. He was by profession
a medical man, and for many years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
during his early residence in the country,
pursued his avocation profitably; but in the
midst of an extending practice he lost his
wife, to whom he was fondly and devotedly
attached. The effect of this blow he never
thoroughly got over, but gradually became in
every respect an altered man. From one of
unflinching energy and firm determination,
he degenerated into a desponding, weak, and
vacillating imbecile; and lingered on in a
mental aberration for some two years, when
he died. During the period of his distraction
it is not surprising that his practice rapidly
declined, and ultimately became completely
destroyed; hence, upon his demise, his family
were left perfectly destitute.</p>

<p>From the time of her mother's death
Eleanor became the director of all the family
affairs, and the domestic responsibility gave
her an appearance of thoughtfulness and care
hardly consistent with one so young; while
the effects still adhering to her, her manner
seemed to retain an habitual reserve and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
melancholy. At the period of her introduction
to John Ferguson she was about sixteen;
her figure, though not absolutely slender, was
light and active, and of that altitude which,
in women, would be considered the medium;
not so short as to appear little, nor so tall but
that she could look up to a man of ordinary
stature. Her form was well modelled, and
rounded off to perfection. Her shoulders
were of that description so generally fashioned
by the chisel of the sculptor, though, possibly,
they were rather a shade too broad; being such
as would give the beholder the idea of the owner,
when more matured, of being a "fine woman."
Her movements were effected with a native
grace, at once denoting the lady; and her
elasticity of tread, and firmness of step, were
only equalled by her loftiness of carriage.
Her face was of the oval form, with a wide
marble forehead (which, but for her winning
modesty and gentle manner, would have been
considered as bearing the stamp of coldness
and hauteur); eyebrows so well defined, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
almost to give an idea of pencilling; deep blue
lustrous eyes, protected by long lashes; a
nose slightly tending to the aquiline; a
mouth of enticing sweetness, and an alabaster
cheek, almost imperceptibly tinged with the
faintest pink. Her hair of "bonny brown,"
and of which she had a luxuriant crop, was
worn slightly off the cheek. Her dress was
neatness and elegance combined; so made as
to come up to the throat, and there terminate
in a neat open collar; under which was a pink
ribbon, contrasting pleasingly with the otherwise
pale-looking features of the wearer. Her
sleeves ended in a band, which encircled her
wrists, and displayed a pair of hands, rivalling
in symmetry the choicest sculpture, and in
whiteness the calico on which she was industriously
employing herself. Her features,
though not perfect, were calm and beautifully
expressive, and the lustre of her complexion
at once struck the beholder with admiration;
while, to her, affectation being unknown, the
easy confidence with which she approached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
and welcomed a stranger, rendered her perfectly
bewitching; and to this description we
may add, that, though in the florescence of
youth, she was in the full bloom of womanhood.</p>

<p>Start not, gentle reader, at the paradox we
have uttered; for in Australia, that land of
precocity, where both vegetable and animal
nature shoots up into maturity so quickly,
the transition appears almost miraculous; and
those we have known yesterday as children,
we are surprised, probably, after a year or
two's absence, to see grown to man or woman's
estate. Such cases are not the exception, but
the rule. So, therefore, be not surprised when
we state that at an age, when, in this staid
old-fashioned going country, match-making
matrons may be thinking of introducing their
daughters to the world, their cognates, the
fair "corn-stalks" of Australia, will not only
have long since made their <i>deb&ucirc;t</i> in society,
but have settled into devoted wives and happy
mothers. And, bless their little hearts! we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
doubt not, but that, as they are matured both
in person and mind at an earlier age, and have
consequently less time and opportunities to
acquire the deceptions of society, they are as
much, if not more, calculated to fulfil their
worldly destiny, with credit to themselves
and happiness to their concomitants, as their
more favoured sisters of our own glorious
isle.</p>

<p>Eleanor Rainsfield, as we have hinted, retained
a cast of melancholy in her features,
which gave her an appearance of coldness and
reserve to strangers, aided, perhaps, by a
natural diffidence and desire for seclusion;
which she preferred to thrusting herself forward,
or mixing much with the world. When
known, however, she was gentle and kind,
with an amiability and candour exceedingly
attractive; and when interested with the
conversation of one for whom she entertained
respect, a smile usually played over her placid
features and made her perfectly irresistible.
This smile would vanish with the cessation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the conversation, and the evanescent animation
pass with it; leaving the stranger in
doubt, when gazing on the returning gloom,
if the former sunshine had been the effect of
pleasurable emotions, or a shadowing forth of
a latent melancholy. She was highly accomplished,
and her mind was the emblem of
purity itself. Her present refuge had been
offered to her by her cousin upon the death of
her father, and gratefully accepted; while the
remainder of the family had been dispersed
amongst various relatives.</p>

<p>The other members of the Rainsfield family
were the children, of whom we have already
made mention, and Thomas Rainsfield, a junior
brother of the proprietor of the station, with
whom he was "acquiring experience." He
was a fine, frank, open-hearted young fellow
of about three-and-twenty; but as he was
absent from home at the period of which we
write, we will defer introducing him to the
reader until we can do so in <i>propria person&aelig;</i>.
In a small cottage, a short distance from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
house, resided Mr. Billing (who acted as clerk
and storekeeper, and whose duties were to
keep the accounts of the station, and distribute
the rations to the men) and his wife
(who officiated as governess); with sundry
olive branches, who bore unmistakeable
evidences, from their facial delineations, of
their Billing paternity.</p>

<p>John Ferguson, in a few words, explained
the nature of the mishap which had occasioned
his visit, and begged Mr. Rainsfield to supply
his wants, until such time as he could receive
a further supply. The required accommodation
was willingly acceded to; and Mr. Rainsfield
remarked that he would give instructions
to Mr. Billing to send it over to Fern Vale,
the first time that he sent out the rations; and
as that would be on the following day, he had
no doubt that the arrangement would suit his
neighbour.</p>

<p>John replied to Mr. Rainsfield, that he was
exceedingly obliged to him for his kind offer;
but stated that as he would be returning to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
station at once, he would save him the trouble
by taking a bag with him on his <a name="horse" id="horse"></a><ins title="original had horse,">horse.</ins></p>

<p>"Nonsense," cried his entertainer, "I can
never think of letting you leave us in such a
hurry; you have nothing that requires your
immediate return, and you may as well favour
us with your company for a few days, at any
rate until you hear of the approach of your
sheep; by which time I expect Tom will have
returned, and no doubt we may manage to
give you a hand to get them over the river.
Besides, the ladies are always complaining of
<i>ennui</i>, and will be happy of your society in
the disposal of a few leisure hours. I am sure
I need not appeal to my wife, to confirm my
welcome; for though she now preserves a strict
silence, I know she is desirous for you to
remain."</p>

<p>"Indeed, my dear," replied the lady, "you
are perfectly correct in your conjectures. I
should indeed be pleased if Mr. Ferguson
would remain with us for a few days; not to
make a convenience of him in the manner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
which you describe, but to impress him with
a favourable idea of the neighbours amongst
whom he has settled. So, if he will allow
himself to be persuaded, we will arrange his
domestication in as short a time as possible."</p>

<p>"I am exceedingly indebted to you, Mrs.
Rainsfield, for your expression of kind feeling,"
exclaimed John; "and, if not putting you to
too great inconvenience, I will accept the hospitality
of your worthy husband and yourself,
to await the approach of my brother."</p>

<p>"Inconvenience?" replied Mrs. Rainsfield;
"who ever heard of inconvenience in the bush?
I have long forgotten the application of the
word; and at any rate, if I could call to mind
its meaning, I never could think of allowing
it to influence me, when the wishes of my
husband are in question;" saying which, and
looking archly at her spouse, she quitted the
room.</p>

<p>"Ah! she's up to some little game now;"
exclaimed that victim laughingly, as his wife
left the apartment: "depend upon it she in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>tends
backing up that soft soap, with some
little scheme of personal aggrandizement. You
can't think, my dear sir," he continued, addressing
John Ferguson, "how these women
manage to get round us, when they take it
into their little heads to flatter our vanity. If
ever you submit to the thraldom of a marital
character, you must be proof against that
weakness."</p>

<p>"I have no idea of the nature of the bondage
to be borne by you self-constituted slaves,"
replied John; "but judging from what I
have witnessed in this house, I should imagine
the allegiance required from you was
not exacting, nor the servitude of a crushing
nature. What do you think, Miss Rainsfield,"
said he, turning to the young lady; "is your
cousin's case a specimen of the general rule
or a solitary exception?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I can hardly say," she replied;
"but would think the happiness of a married
life depended in a great measure upon a congeniality
of temper, mutual forbearance, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
reciprocity of kindly feeling, existing between
the parties concerned; and that if
amiability is allied to impetuosity, or petulance
to generosity, the result must necessarily
prove disastrous."</p>

<p>"Well done, my little oracle," ejaculated her
cousin; "there now, sir, you have a dissertation
on matrimony, and a moral, the truth of
which I doubt if you'll ever dispute. But
my cousin has surely turned philosopher, and
is moralizing in expectancy on her own engagement;
but forgive me, Nell" (he continued, as
the young lady cast a reproachful look at him
that made him regret the allusion), "I did not
intend to pain you by any reference to your
<i>affair d'amour</i>; I had no idea it was an unpleasant
subject with you." So, after making
what he thought the <i>amende honorable</i> to his
cousin; but in reality only doing, as all men
do who attempt to explain away some pain-giving
remark; that is, adding poignancy to
the wounding shaft; he led off his visitor to
accompany him round the station.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>In accepting the invitation to sojourn with
this family for a few days, we suspect it was
something more than the mere desire to wait
for his brother, that influenced John Ferguson.
It had been his intention, when he left
his own place, to proceed on the road to meet
William, and lend him his assistance in driving
the sheep; and, therefore, there appears
something inexplicable in his remaining inactive
at Strawberry Hill. Could it be that
any feeling of admiration for his entertainer's
fair cousin had exercised any spell in his
detention; or that he was merely pleased
with the people with whom he found himself,
and desired to cultivate their acquaintance?
We suspect, rather, that the fascination of the
young lady was the secret cause, though,
perhaps, unknown even to John himself. 'Tis
true, he could not divest his thoughts of her
image; from passing events they continually
wandered, and incessantly reverted to a contemplation
of her calm and placid features.
In his thoughts, Eleanor Rainsfield was ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
present; and though each meditation of her
intruded itself without causing a thought of
the nature of the feeling he was fostering, he at
last found himself deeply involved in a mental
enunciation of her charms; which concluded
in the decision, that she was indeed a
creature to be prized; and if not perfection
itself, the nearest approach to it, that it is the
fortune of mortals to witness.</p>

<p>"She really is a charming girl," he mentally
exclaimed; "but why am I continually thinking
of her? I have no desire to be married;
besides which, her cousin taxed her with an
engagement, and, by the bye, she did not
relish the allusion. I wonder what it can
mean; she seemed dejected too; and, now I
remember, she appeared to lay particular stress
upon the requisites that ensured happiness to
the married state. She must already be engaged,
and that engagement, if I divine
rightly, cannot be congenial to her spirit;
there is some slight mystery that requires
solving. Dear me!" he continued, after a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
few moments of inert meditation, "I can't get
that girl out of my head. I can't think what
makes me take such an interest in her affairs;
it is surely no concern of mine. I must shake
off the thoughts of her:" and with that
amiable determination he commenced whistling
a popular air to delude himself, while he
turned to his companion, who had in the
meantime stopped in his walk to watch his
abstractedness.</p>

<p>After spending some time in looking over
the domestic arrangements of the station, the
two gentlemen bent their steps to the Wombi
river. In the course of their walk John Ferguson
remarked, that he thought the present
crossing-place did not appear a very judicious
choice, and asked his companion if a safer and
more eligible spot could not be found.</p>

<p>"I think not," replied Mr. Rainsfield. "At
the place where you crossed the river it is at
its widest point; and at the time I selected it,
it was the shallowest part of the stream. Then
there was a sand bank right in the bed of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
river, which made a crossing quite practicable;
but, since the last 'fresh' I find the sand bank
is washed away, and nothing is now left in its
place but a deposit of mud; so I fear nothing
will improve it now. I have had an idea for
some time of putting up a bridge, if I could get
any of the settlers to join me; but you see at
present there is no one besides you and I, who
would be benefitted by it; and it would
be rather too expensive an undertaking for us
to perform by ourselves."</p>

<p>"As you say," replied Ferguson, "at
present we are the only ones that would be
convenienced by its erection; but if we can't
procure any assistance from government, we
might induce Mr. Robert Smithers to join us:
for if he has taken up all the country down the
river bank for the distance which I understand
he has, it would be to his interest to
afford us assistance; for a bridge over the
Wombi would materially affect the sale of his
runs."</p>

<p>"I am inclined to differ from you there,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
said Mr. Rainsfield. "I don't think Smithers
would see the advantage in the same light
which you and I do; he is perfectly aware that
any one wanting the country, would be very
little influenced by the existence of a river
in his way. People are too well accustomed
to such impediments, and, I doubt not, would
make a deviation of fifty miles from the direct
course, by travelling up the stream to find
another crossing, rather than expend a small
sum in putting up a bridge, for, what they
would consider, our exclusive benefit. And as
to government assistance, you might as soon
expect the aid of Jupiter. Never, until the
country is settled some hundreds of miles
further out, and they have, after repeated
importunities, established a post-office somewhere
beyond this, and had half the postmen
in the country drowned from swimming the
river in times of flood, would they think a
bridge at all necessary. If you like to accompany
me to the river I will show you a spot
I have often looked upon as a likely one for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
bridge; where the banks are steep and the
river narrow. I think a log bridge could be
put over at a very moderate cost, and if we
can induce Bob Smithers to fall into our
views (though I doubt it), I would propose
that we go about it at once. To ascertain his
inclination, however, I will write him; and if
I think any good can be done, I will myself
ride over to Brompton and see him."</p>

<p>The plan met with the ready concurrence
of John Ferguson; and they continued their
walk, to look at the spot to which Mr. Rainsfield
referred; and arriving there, they stood
contemplating its advantages. As Mr. Rainsfield
had remarked, the banks were very steep
and lofty; and the river confined within narrow
limits, ran more rapidly than elsewhere.
On the sloping banks grew some gigantic
gum trees, which Mr. Rainsfield proposed
felling in such a way, as to fall across the
stream (which he calculated they would do);
and then two or three so placed, with a flooring
of smaller saplings, and a coating of earth, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
substantial, and economical structure could be
erected; while with a little labour expended
<a name="in" id="in"></a><ins title="original had n">in</ins> partially levelling the approaches, it would
answer the purposes of the most solid edifice.
They both agreed that the site was an eligible
one, and offered facilities which should not be
neglected; and with this belief, and determining
to use some exertions to carry out
their idea, they turned to retrace their steps to
the house; when Mr. Rainsfield drew John's
attention to the forms of some aborigines, who
were skulking behind the trees in the distance
on the opposite side of the river.</p>

<p>"Those fellows," said he, "are all abroad;
their camp is on the other side of the Gibson,
in the scrub below us; and they evidently
want to get over here, to cross by 'the flats'
beyond our place, instead of swimming the
river above. Bob Smithers must be out of
the way, or they would not venture a chance
of falling in with him; he always keeps them
off his brother's run if he can help it; and he
generally succeeds, for he has the active<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
management of the station, and his word is
law. I have been obliged to follow his
example lately myself, for I have been so
much troubled by their pilfering, that I have
determined to keep them away from the
place. Not long ago, I caught one of them
walking off with one of the men's rations,
which the stupid fellow left exposed; and I
gave the delinquent a charge of shot, which
made him speedily relinquish his booty, and
impart to his tribe a healthy dread of the consequences
of pilfering from Strawberry Hill.
Now, unfortunately, I anticipate further
trouble with them; for the blackguards have
got a ruffian amongst them who is perfectly
conversant with our usages and customs; and
he has assumed the chiefship of the tribe."</p>

<p>"I had a visit from them myself yesterday,"
replied John, "and detained two of their boys
on my station. I expect to be able to make
use of them in many ways; and, if need be,
I can keep them as hostages for the well
behaviour of their countrymen."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>"I am afraid that you are labouring under
a delusion," said Rainsfield; "and you will find
that you are adopting the very worst course
you could. By retaining those fellows on your
station you will encourage the others of the
tribe to come on your run: indeed, while you
detain these boys, you will not be able to keep
their friends away. And if they take into their
heads to rob you (which in all probability
they will), the two that you have in your
service will be made by their fellows to communicate
regular intelligence of your movements;
and you will find you have been
harbouring a viper in your bosom."</p>

<p>"I have already," replied John, "been inclined
to think that kind treatment towards
the blacks is better policy than harshness;
conciliation is more natural than banishment;
and I cannot think any race of savages can
be so morally depraved as to commit depredations
on their benefactors. They are far
more likely to indulge in acts of reprisal, where
their evil passions are excited by cupidity, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
animated by a thirst to revenge some act of
aggression or cruelty. For my own part (and
my brother agrees with me in the policy), I <a name="intend" id="intend"></a><ins title="original had in-end">intend</ins>
to cultivate their good feeling, by acting
towards them in a kindly manner; of course
with a certain degree of firmness; for I would
resent any of their peccadillos. I am fully
cognizant of their predilection for appropriation,
and will take every precaution to
prevent an exercise of their propensities; but,
at the same time, I can't reconcile myself to
the idea, of visiting petty delinquencies with
the severity which you recommend."</p>

<p>"Well, we shall see how you succeed," returned
his companion; "I found from experience
it was perfectly impossible to preserve
order, and retain my property, while the black
villains were permitted to overrun my place;
and I had no peace until I adopted stringent
measures, and got rid of their annoyance by
expatriation. I don't believe your principle of
leniency is practicable, and am convinced you
will soon have cause to regret its trial, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
will be brought to my way of thinking; therefore,
I should strongly advise you to relinquish
the idea at once, and relieve yourself of an
immensity of trouble and anxiety in the
future."</p>

<p>"No," replied John, "my mind is fixed; I
am determined to try the working of my plan,
and am sanguine of success. It is true the
blacks in this part of the country, are wilder
than those I have been accustomed to mix
with; but I've very little doubt, but that I'll
be able to live on terms of amity with them,
and avoid all those hostile contiguities, which
we are led to expect are incidental on a residence
in this district."</p>

<p>"Well," said Rainsfield, "I must confess
myself sceptical of a favourable result, and
only trust your experiment may not have a
tragical termination; for I've no faith in the
aborigines: they are treacherous in the extreme,
and will commit any act of violence to
possess themselves of a coveted article. I
myself have known shepherds on out-stations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
murdered by them, for the sake of their rations,
or even a blanket, which had excited
their avarice."</p>

<p>"It is true," said John, "we hear of such
cases; but, in nine out of ten, I believe the
black perpetrating the act of violence, has been
one who has been domesticated with the
whites; and having been brought into contact
with the vilest of our race, and acquired all
the vices which have been daily presented to
his sight, it is not to be wondered at, that
(having these constantly submitted to him for
his example and emulation, and without the
influence of moral obligations) he should perpetrate
the very acts he has heard lightly
treated of, or perhaps extolled. But, with the
aboriginal in his native state, and without the
degrading influence of civilised immorality,
you rarely, or never, meet with such violation
of the ethical and natural laws."</p>

<p>"The very depravity which you have described,"
replied the other, "is the accomplishment
possessed by the chief of that tribe which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
is our neighbour; so you know exactly what
you have to expect from him and his."</p>

<p>"I doubt not," said John, "if the fellow is of
the nature you mention, he will have sufficient
cunning, and natural instinct, to perceive that
a friendly intercourse with me will be more
advantageous to him than a constant warfare;
for, after all, these fellows must be gifted with
reasoning faculties. They must know, that
where their visits are permitted so long as
they maintain their integrity, and their wants
to a certain extent supplied, it is far better
for them to continue that state of peacefulness,
than by an act of aggression to forfeit the
privilege for ever."</p>

<p>"I see," said Rainsfield, "you are enthusiastically
intent upon pursuing this plan of
ingratiating yourself with your sable neighbours;
and I sincerely trust your good intentions
may not be misdirected."</p>

<p>By this time the peripatetic disquisition
was terminated by the friends reaching the
house; and, entering the sitting-room, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
found the ladies had for some time been waiting
their return. Upon an enquiry from Mrs.
Rainsfield, what had detained them so long,
her husband replied,</p>

<p>"Nothing very particular, my dear; we
strolled down to the Wombi to look at a
spot where a bridge could be thrown across,
and Mr. Ferguson and I got into a discussion
about the blacks; and he defended them in
such an able and spirited manner that the
time slipped by unconsciously. You must
know, my dear, our friend here is going to
establish himself on a friendly footing with
the black fellows; and I shouldn't be surprised
to see a model black settlement as the
result of his moral training."</p>

<p>"I commend Mr. Ferguson for his justice,"
replied the lady; and turning to John, she continued,
"I only wish, sir, you could induce my
husband to be of the same way of thinking;
for he persists in keeping the poor creatures
aloof from the place, and I am confident they
are perfectly harmless. Before the sentence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
banishment was pronounced against them, we
found them exceedingly useful. For some
time I had a young 'gin' in the house as a
servant, and she was quite as handy as any
white one I ever had; besides which, she was
very partial to the children, and they were
very fond of her."</p>

<p>"I am delighted, my dear madam,"
exclaimed our hero, "to think that my views
meet with your approval; and I have no
doubt that when I prove their practicability,
I shall be enabled to induce your husband to
adopt them." With this remark he turned
<a name="to" id="to"></a><ins title="original had duplicate to">to</ins> Miss Rainsfield, and met her gaze, which
was fixed upon his features with a smile of
approval. She hastily removed her eyes, when
she perceived John had noticed her; but not
before the momentary glance had penetrated
his heart, and rendered him thoughtful and
abstracted for the remainder of the evening.</p>

<p>Another day had passed, and a third had
shed its light on Strawberry Hill, and still
John Ferguson lingered there. It is true the
inmates of the house pressed him to stay;
but it required little pressing to induce him to
continue a visit which was so grateful and congenial
to his wishes. He had spent long hours
in the society of the ladies, and had rambled
with them through the shades of the bush.
He was irresistibly spell-bound to the spot,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
though he professed to himself utter ignorance
of any retentive influence. Despite his repeated
personal assurances that he had no
amative object or gratification in his partiality
for the society of his new-made friends, it
must be admitted that the presence and companionship
of Miss Rainsfield had more attractions
for him than he pretended to admit;
though the fact that his heart was a little interested
in the matter at last began to dawn
upon his mind. It was in fact almost impossible
for any man, whose affections were not
pre-engaged, to live in the enjoyment of a
contiguity with such a creature as Eleanor
Rainsfield without feeling deeply the fascination
of her cultivated mind, her charming
person, and graceful unaffected manner.
How much more susceptible of a loving impress,
then, must have been the mind of John
Ferguson, who retaining nature's freshness itself,
at once perceived a kindred spirit in the
fair cousin of Mr. Rainsfield.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the charming girl her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>self&mdash;young
and inexperienced, early deprived
of the guiding influence of her fond parents,
and seldom mixing in society&mdash;had very rare
opportunities of forming any opinion of the
world or its motives; and knew not the accomplished
art of dissembling her feelings,
when the ice of her outward reserve had been
once broken. The conversation and ingenuous
manner of her companion pleased her,
and she took an interest and pleasure in his
society, which she had no idea of concealing.
What her feelings were, at this period
of her acquaintance with Ferguson, it were
difficult to surmise; but, in all probability
they were embraced in a friendly regard for
him, whose mind and character she intuitively
esteemed: a species of admiration, engendering
a confidence in their friendly intercourse; and
which in the breast of a young girl, actuated
solely by the spontaneous actions of her own
feelings, tends more than anything to beget a
feeling of affection for the man who thus
engrosses her attention. There is perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
no friendship which produces so fond a recollection
as this; and no feeling so likely to
favourably impress a youthful and ardent-minded
creature as that which induces her to
pour her thoughts, without restraint, into the
ear of him with whom she converses; even
though they be the merest platitudes. That
confidence, with which she is led on to unveil
her soul, carries with it a regard which is
indelibly impressed on her mind; and such
was the feeling with which Eleanor regarded
John Ferguson, though she too was unacquainted
with the presence of any sentiment
other than mere friendship; but we are anticipating.</p>

<p>As we have said, time was not stationary
at Strawberry Hill, nor on the road; for on
the day our narrative continues with, Tom
Rainsfield made his appearance, with the
intelligence that he had only a short time
previously left William Ferguson on the road
with his sheep; so that he might be expected
to be at the crossing-place on the Wombi,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
within an hour or so. Tom was instantly
introduced to John Ferguson; and volunteered,
as soon as he had satisfied the calls of
hunger, to return with him to the river, and
assist in getting the sheep over.</p>

<p>The offer was thankfully declined by John,
who assured the other, that he and his
brother, with the assistance of their men,
were perfectly adequate to the task; but it
was generously persisted in by young Rainsfield;
and, in a short time afterwards, the two
were to be seen bending their steps to the
crossing-place, which they reached about the
same time that William and his flocks slowly
wended their way to the river.</p>

<p>We have stated, at the first mention of his
name to the reader, that Tom Rainsfield was
a fine generous-minded young fellow. At the
time of his arrival at Strawberry Hill, he
had just finished a long equestrian journey,
and was necessarily tired and fatigued; so
that the readiness with which he proffered his
assistance to the Fergusons was an instance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
kindness, and an obliging disposition, which
was his general character. He was dressed
in the usual bush costume, viz, jumper,
breeches and belt, riding boots, spurs, and
cabbage-tree hat; and in his frank open countenance
could at once be read the genuineness
of his friendship. He was in truth a
noble fellow; high-spirited and warm-hearted;
bold and daring, though, perhaps, a little
thoughtless and impetuous. His figure, though
not decidedly tall, was of a good height, light
and elegantly formed, and altogether was such
as would command the admiration of the fair
sex; while the facile freedom of his speech,
the easy grace of his manners, and his gentlemanly
bearing, were sufficient to insure the
respect of his fellows, and to establish, on a
lasting footing, the esteem of his friends.</p>

<p>During their short walk from the house
the two young men had naturally fallen into
conversation, and had, even in that limited
period, become mutually attached to each other.</p>

<p>"I overtook your brother on the road," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Tom, in the continuation of a dialogue, "and,
knowing it could be none other than he, I
introduced myself, and we knew one another
at once. He is a fine fellow, and just my style.
If you don't favour us much with your company
at our place I promise you you shall
have enough of me at yours; for your brother
and I will be sworn friends. He tells me, too,
that he expects his sister is coming to place herself
under your bachelor protection: is such the
case? You have said nothing about it up at
the Hill, or I think they would have told me."</p>

<p>"I made no mention of the circumstance,"
replied John, "to either your brother or his
lady, as, as yet, it is by no means decided
upon; for my own part, I hardly like the idea
of bringing the poor girl out to this remote
part of the country. I should prefer seeing
it a little more settled first, though my brother
William is madly anxious to get her out with
us; she herself, I think, could be easily influenced
either the one way or the other."</p>

<p>"Then by all means let her join you," cried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Tom; "give William his way, and us the
pleasure of knowing her. If there is any
hesitation on your part, I will enlist the
services of our women folk; and if they don't
tease you into compliance before a month is
over, it is a caution. Why, they'll be madly
hilarious, when they hear the bare mention of
such a scheme; they surely can't be aware of
the fact of your possessing such a treasure as a
sister, or I am sure they would be on to you
at once to induce a visit from her."</p>

<p>"Under any circumstances, it will require
some delay," replied John; "as we could not
think of getting her to join us, until we had
established some comfortable home to bring
her to; and I fear it will be a considerable
time ere that can be accomplished."</p>

<p>"That's easily managed," returned Tom.
"Never mind your house; she can come on
a visit to us until you get your place ready.
I am sure our folks will be delighted to have
her company. Eleanor will be a very suitable
companion for her; and I am sure she will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
be an acquisition to Eleanor, who sadly wants
a lively companion of her own age. I am confident
your sister would dispel much of our
cousin's settled melancholy, and make her see
the sacrifice she is contemplating."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt the girls would suit each
other admirably," replied John; "and if I
think myself justified in asking my sister, and
she can be persuaded to come out here, I
doubt not they will soon become friends; but
may I ask to what you allude by your cousin's
sacrifice?"</p>

<p>"Simply marriage to one to whom she
considers herself engaged," said Tom, "while,
in my opinion, it is perfect folly; she is absolutely
throwing herself away. I cannot
bring myself to think she entertains any liking
for the man, for I don't believe any intellectual
woman could discover anything in him worthy
of esteem. You are acquainted with him,
though no doubt his character is better known
to me than to you, for I have had more
opportunities of observing it. It is Bob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Smithers; and she has consented to marry
him through the importunities of his sister-in-law.
It appears Mrs. Smithers was an intimate
friend of Eleanor's mother, and used to
joke Eleanor about Bob; who, when a younger
man, and when my cousin was a mere child,
used to be particularly attentive to her; so,
amongst them, a match was made up between
the two. Since then Eleanor has seen very
little of her betrothed; but his assiduous
advocate, his sister-in-law, has continued to
press his suit; and obtained from Eleanor a
renewal of her pledge. In fact, the poor girl
has been absolutely cajoled into an acceptance,
as much from an ignorance of Bob's character,
and a desire to gratify her mother's friend, as
from any feelings of her own. I will do Mrs.
Smithers the justice to say, I believe she does
not know the extent of her brother-in-law's
vileness; and that what she considers his little
weaknesses, will be effectually rectified by a
union with our Eleanor; but I don't like to
see the poor girl sacrificed, and have a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
mind to save her (if she would take me) by
proposing to her myself; though I believe she
thinks her word irrevocable, and will submit
to Bob's claim as the fulfilment of a duty.
I believe Smithers intends pushing his suit
shortly himself; for when he disposes of
another block or two of his country, he
intends stocking the remainder of his runs
with the proceeds of what he has sold, and
settling down for himself. However, it will
take him some little time before he can complete
his plans, and if I can prevent his
marrying Eleanor I will do so."</p>

<p>Tom Rainsfield continued conversing, or
audibly soliloquizing in this strain, without
noticing the abstraction into which his companion
had fallen; and might have prolonged,
even for an hour, his declamation against Bob
Smithers, had not the current of his thoughts
been arrested, and John Ferguson aroused
from his reverie, by their being hailed from
the opposite bank by William, who had
arrived with the sheep.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>This was the signal for animation; and for
hours all the party were busily engaged effecting
a passage of the stream with the ovine
mass; while the sun had just began to dip on
the horizon, as the last of the animals passed
the fluvial barrier.</p>

<p>"Now," said Tom, as he gazed upon the
assembled flock on the Wombi's bank, "you
had better let the men camp here with the
sheep for the night, and you and William
come up and spend the evening, and stop
the night with us."</p>

<p>To this advice, however, there was one dissenting
voice, and that voice was John's. He
had, within the previous hour, lost the interest
he had before experienced in a visit to Strawberry
Hill; or rather, he now wished to avoid
the place altogether. And yet his heart
yearned for one of the residents; he desired to
bask in the inspiring smile of his spirit's
charmer; he felt a longing to gaze once more
into the face of Eleanor Rainsfield, and read
in her eyes, either the confirmation of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
fears, or the entire repudiation of any such
engagement as that mentioned by her cousin.
Alas, poor John! he was hopelessly enthralled
in Cupid's bondage, and he felt it; though his
calmer judgment whispered to him an indulgence
of such a sentiment was selfish and useless.
If such an attachment, or even engagement
(he thought to himself), did exist, and of that,
from his friend's affirmation, he had no doubt, it
must have been entered into with her consent,
and evident approval; for by her cousin's
account she was immovable, even to his
entreaty; why, therefore, should he, almost a
stranger, attempt to interpose himself between
her and her evident inclination? Such were
the thoughts that contended in his mind, when
he wished to avoid the Hill, and take his departure
at once with the sheep for his own
station.</p>

<p>His brother, however, was differently disposed;
he had travelled a long distance, and
was pretty tired of his vocation; he knew
that the animals could not travel much further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
that day, and if they proceeded another two
or three miles they would have to halt just the
same; while nothing would be gained, but the
probability of having to camp with them. So,
bushman though he was, he preferred comfortable
quarters for the night, to a stretcher
beside a camp fire. He therefore raised his
voice against his brother's objection; and John
was thus out-voted in the conclave, and compelled
to submit to the over-ruling of his companions.
They, therefore, made arrangements
for the halt; informing their men that they
would be with them on the morning by daylight;
and then joined their friend, and
sauntered towards the house.</p>

<p>From Tom the ladies soon learnt the scheme
of the brothers with regard to their sister, and
were importunate in their entreaties to hurry
her arrival. John Ferguson, who had not
recovered the despondency the communication
of Tom had thrown him into, was quite bewildered
with the badinage that was directed
to him from all quarters during the even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>ing,
for his reluctance in bringing his sister
out to the station. Mrs. Rainsfield affirmed
that it was because he was such a confirmed
bachelor, he could not bear the thought of
being under a lady's dominion, even though it
were his sister; while Tom declared his belief
that Mr. Ferguson was afraid of presenting her,
for fear that he, Tom, would effect a reprisal,
and walk off with her. Even as it was, he
said, he would not answer for himself; if Miss
Ferguson was as charming as he fully anticipated
she would prove, he thought he would
enter into a compact with her brothers and
secure her at once.</p>

<p>All this raillery and playfulness, was little
heeded by John Ferguson, who remained
particularly abstracted; so much so, that it
became distinctly discernible, and the loquacity
of his friends gradually subdued. As the
conversation began to slacken, Miss Rainsfield
raised her eyes from her work, and addressing
their taciturn visitor in the sweetest possible
voice, asked him if he would not allow his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
sister to remain on a visit with them for a
short time, before she fixed her abode with
her brothers; so as to give her an opportunity
of settling herself in her new home,
making her acquaintance with her neighbours,
and affording them the pleasure of her
society.</p>

<p>John was roused to consciousness by this
appeal, and replied that he would be most
happy to be the means of his sister cultivating
and enjoying their friendship; but that if
she made up her mind to live with her
brothers at Fern Vale, she would be her own
mistress, and have entire control over her own
actions; so that the acceptance and prolongation
of any visit would in a great measure depend
upon her own whim. He said, however,
from what he knew of her disposition, he had
no doubt she would far prefer the agreeable
society of such friends as Mrs. and Miss
Rainsfield, to the dull monotony of a
guardianship of two bachelor brothers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p><p>The conversation, after this episode,
brightened, and was continued in a pleasing
strain for the remainder of the evening.</p>

<p>On the following morning, true to their
word, the young men took their departure,
and reached their station without the occurrence
of an event worth recording; and for the
next two or three days, they were fully occupied
in the settlement of matters at Fern
Vale. In the midst of a routine of business,
John Ferguson had little time to think of
matters relating to his feelings; but when the
first bustle succeeded to leisure, his thoughts
of Eleanor returned with redoubled force. He
would then picture to his imagination her expressive
features; he would dream of her
abstractedly by day, and her form was the
subject of his visions by night; and yet, though
he thought her personal charms the perfection
of frail humanity, his admiration was not so
much for the outward fane, as the spirit that
held dominion within. It is true his attention
had been first arrested by her beauty; but
the cause of those after feelings, which now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
consumed his soul, was the constant contemplation
of her gentleness, amiability, mental
accomplishments, and pure unsullied spirit.
These were they which won his love, and
secured his heart in a hopeless thraldom. In
its empire he had established one sovereign,
who was supreme, and that sovereign was
Eleanor; his soul had but one idol, and the
deity of this feticism was Eleanor; his mind
had raised one standard of human perfection,
and the motto of that standard, the excelsior
of his fate, was Eleanor. The spirit of Eleanor
was in every bush; her face smiled down
upon him from every tree; the very birds
seemed for the time, in his presence, to forget
their natural utterance, and screamed in
various tones of dissonance the name of
Eleanor. And yet (he would think in his
musings) this prize was not to be his; she
was the cherished of another, to whom she
had pledged her love. What then was left
for him? Why should he entertain one
thought of her? It was clear the possession<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
of this treasure was never for him; then why
should he allow her to retain dominion in his
mind?</p>

<p>These mental interrogations he could not
answer to his own satisfaction. He attempted
to argue himself into a belief that he was mistaken
in his feelings towards her; that she was
not, in fact, the beacon towards which all his
hopes were directed; but the sophistry failed
to offer consolation to his wounded spirit, and
he felt that he could not banish her from
his thoughts: the task was hopeless.</p>

<p>Weeks passed away thus, without the
occurrence of any event specially worth
chronicling. Tom Rainsfield and William
Ferguson had become inseparable friends, and
were constantly together, either at the one
station or the other; while John's visits to his
neighbouring friends were short, and at remote
intervals. His manner had become thoughtful
and grave, and had not failed <a name="attract" id="attract"></a><ins title="original had toat tract">to attract</ins> the
notice of his friends, from its contrast to his
usual character. Shearing had commenced;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
and his mind, from the constant diversion of
his thoughts, had partially recovered its
wonted elasticity. His sister had expressed
her willingness to join her brothers; and the
dray having arrived from Alma, with the
necessary materials to complete their dwelling,
John had hurried on the carpenters with
their work.</p>

<p>It was determined by the Fergusons that
the dray then on the station, should go down
to town with the first load of their wool; and
that William should follow it, and procure
furniture and other necessaries for it to
return with. He was then to proceed to his
father's house, take up his sister, bring her
round to the station by way of Mr. Dawson's,
and leave her at Strawberry Hill for a week
or two, until the house at Fern Vale was ready
for her reception. These various arrangements
being completed; such as the despatch
of the dray, the acquaintance of Mr. Ferguson
at Acacia Creek of their plans, and the arrival
of the other dray with supplies; William<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
took his departure; and John, after he had
despatched a second load of wool, rode over
to Strawberry Hill to make a personal delivery
of the salt he had borrowed from Mr.
Rainsfield.</p>

<p>It had been some time since John Ferguson
had paid his respects at Strawberry Hill, and
his visit on this occasion was hailed with no
little surprise, and possibly with a good deal
of pleasure by more than one member of the
family. Mrs. Rainsfield was particular in her
enquiries, as to the cause of his continuing to
seclude himself, and anxiously inquisitive for
a solution of his mysterious melancholy.
Eleanor was unaltered, either in personal
appearance or her manner towards him; she
entertained the same admiration, and though
her heart whispered to her suspicions, that
she was in some way connected with his
dejection, she had no idea of the extent of his
feelings' ravishment. At the same time she
did not deem any secresy of her admiration
essential to a compatibility with modesty. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
found pleasure in the society of John Ferguson;
liked his manner and person; and
therefore threw into her reception of him,
when they met, a warmth and cordiality,
which, though only expressive of her own pure
friendship, filled with ecstatic glow the very
blood of her enraptured lover. She was, in
fact, though unconsciously to herself, with the
spirit she was investing in the mere exercise
of common-place formalities, creating, or rather
strengthening, a feeling in the breast of John
Ferguson, which never could be eradicated;
but which would, of a certainty, consume his
life and spirits, if he were not blessed with a
reciprocal attachment.</p>

<p>In the present interview, however, Eleanor
did not join with the lady of the house in her
playful badinage; indeed, it was not her usual
manner; but she had eyes, and those eyes
(differing from the followers of Mr. Irving)
spoke in no unknown tongue, at least to John;
to him they had the power of communicating
in many languages, so that when she gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
him a look, in which was embodied all she
wished to convey, its meaning was instantly
and rightly interpreted by our hero. If we
were called upon to describe in words the
tumultuous ragings of those elements that
cleave the very mountains, lay prostrate the
gigantic denizens of the forest, and make the
earth tremble with the power of their agitation;
if we were required to depict the falling
avalanche, that sweeps in its course all vestiges
of vitality from the face of the earth; or
to form an adequate conception of the occult
ramifications of the electric fluid, which is at
man's pleasure made to compass the globe
with the quickness of thought, we would confess
ourselves incompetent. Equally so are
we to describe the glance of a woman. Some
looks there are, however, which, though inexplicable
to uninitiated spectators, to those who
cherish even a corruscation of mental light,
speak volumes of information; and such it
was that Eleanor cast upon John Ferguson.
What was conveyed in that look we will not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
pretend to fathom; but simply affirm that its
effect was an entire derangement of the love-sick
swain's determination to forget the cause
of his wretchedness, and a dispersion of every
idea save the one ruling sentiment of love for
her. Thus, in a moment, discretion was forgotten,
and resolution cast to the wind; and
he blindly satiated himself with deep draughts
of love's ambrosia, without a moment's contemplation
of the remote chances, or absolute
impossibility of his ever possessing the fountain
source.</p>

<p>Eve's fair daughters have always an eye
for the discernment and evolution of love's
mysterious workings; and often detect the
existence of the tender passion, where the
percipiency of their lords' mental penetralia
fails to enlighten them on its presence. Hence,
while Mr. Rainsfield never dreamed of John
Ferguson being a rival of Smithers for the
hand of Eleanor, and before she herself even
thoroughly knew it, his weaker half had
made the discovery with considerable delight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
and communicated the knowledge to her
spouse.</p>

<p>By him the news was received in a far
different spirit than was expected by his wife;
and he at once remarked that he would take
an immediate opportunity of warning his
young friend against entertaining any feeling
beyond friendship for Eleanor. He reminded
his wife that the girl had voluntarily engaged
herself to Smithers, and would therefore
marry him; consequently, there was no use
torturing Ferguson, by allowing him to
cherish hopes which were not destined to be
fulfilled.</p>

<p>"But why should they not be?" replied his
wife: "I am certain he loves Eleanor, and am
pretty sure that Eleanor loves him. That she
does not entertain any such feeling for
Smithers I am confident; she has been forced,
more than otherwise, into that engagement
with him, and the very thought of attaching
herself to him for life is making her wretched.
If you took the trouble to notice her, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
would perceive with what pleasure she receives
the attention of Mr. Ferguson; and I am convinced
he has only to declare himself to
receive an unqualified consent."</p>

<p>"Well, I beg you will not mention the subject
to her," said Rainsfield; "so long as she
remains engaged to Bob Smithers you surely
do not intend to argue that it is proper for
her to receive the attention of another admirer.
If she refuses Smithers, then I can see no
objection to her favouring the suit of our
neighbour; but until then it were only madness
to give Ferguson any encouragement.
I shall warn him of his danger at once, and
again request you to maintain silence to
Eleanor on the subject."</p>

<p>"For my part," persisted the lady, "I don't
think Smithers is entitled to such consideration:
he rarely or never visits Eleanor; he
shows her no attention; and takes it for
granted his claims are indisputable, and that
she is ready to accept him whenever it is his
convenience to take her. If Eleanor had the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
slightest spirit in her nature she would scorn
such a man; and I think it is entirely a false
notion of rectitude that makes her adhere to
the engagement."</p>

<p>"It may be in opposition to her happiness,
my dear," replied her husband, "but it cannot
be a false notion of rectitude, as you call it; it
is rather rectitude in the strictest sense. She
has been induced to accept Mr. Smithers, and
to ratify it on more than one occasion; consequently,
it is not for us to judge, whether
she will be happy or not in such a connexion,
but to leave her to her own free will and
judgment; therefore, I say again, while this
engagement exists, it is not right to allow
young Ferguson to imagine he has any
chance of acceptance."</p>

<p>"But I know he would not be refused,"
replied Mrs. Rainsfield.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" exclaimed the husband, "it is
wonderful how you women will persevere in
a cause that you interest yourselves in.
There is no use in your reiterating that ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>pression,
however; for I tell you again, that
John Ferguson must be cautioned against
allowing himself to be carried away by his
feelings; and I am confident, that when I
point out to him the nature of his position,
his good sense will enable him to see its
untenableness, and cause him to desist from
any pointed attentions."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rainsfield was a dutiful wife, and,
however much against her own inclinations, she
submitted to her husband's wishes; though
she left his presence grieved and disappointed.
She well knew that a match between Eleanor
and Smithers would prove unhappy; while she
was as fully certain that a union with John
Ferguson would be as felicitous as any human
connexion could be. We will not say that the
spirit of match-making, inherent in the nature
of all matrons, was wounded at its defeat;
although she certainly cherished the idea of
bringing the two young people together, it
was not so much with the mere wish to be
the means of accomplishing a ceremony, as to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
see them happy. For she had a sincere desire
for the welfare of Eleanor, for whom she felt
a compassion on account of her dependent
condition, and an attachment for her virtues
and affectionate manner to herself; besides the
esteem, we have already said, she felt for our
hero. She, however, determined, without a
violation of her husband's commands, to sound
Eleanor upon the subject of her engagement
with Smithers; and if she perceived any
disposition to break off on her part, to give
John a hint of the probability of his success,
if he renewed his suit.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mr. Rainsfield took the
opportunity of which he spoke to his wife,
and communicated to John the utter hopelessness
of his persevering in his attentions to
the young lady; informing him that her
affections were already engaged; and recommended
him, for his own peace of mind, that
he should banish all thoughts of an amative
nature. Mr. Rainsfield further remarked, that
he felt himself in justice bound to give his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
friend that caution, before he allowed any
warm feeling to take a firm possession of his
heart; at the same time, he assured him
their conversation was unknown to the lady
herself, as was also, so he had reason to
believe, the state of his feelings towards her.
Therefore, John need not consider the annihilation
of his hopes of obtaining her hand, a
decree of banishment from Strawberry Hill.</p>

<p>Before the conclusion of this little exordium
John had become perfectly unconscious; and,
at its termination, mechanically shook the
hand of his interlocutor, while he took his departure.
All the communication that he could
comprehend, was, that it was intended to dispel
all the bright illusions love's fancy had
conjured in his mind. All his momentary
visions of prospective happiness were swept
away, like the misty canopy of the mountain
before the morning breeze. His ariel palaces
of imaginative grandeur, lay shattered at his
feet; and he stood like the last of a defeated
host, viewing destruction and desolation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
around him. His fondest hopes were blighted;
he felt as one robbed of his very soul; he was
wretched and dejected, and turned from the
spot with the feelings of an outcast, an alien;
or as a once powerful courtier, removed from
the presence of his sovereign, to a perpetual
expatriation. Strawberry Hill had for ever
lost its interest to him; the only treasure it
contained held out no prospect of possession.
In his heart there was a blank, which nothing
short of his idol could fill; but it was empty,
and seared; and vacant was his mind, and
miserable his feelings, as he leisurely journeyed
on his way to Fern Vale. They were, in fact,
such as can be better imagined than described;
and when he reached his station, and delivered
his horse to one of his men in silence, he went
about his usual vocations as one almost destitute
of reason.</p>

<p>What the feelings of the lady most concerned
were, had they been consulted, we can
well understand; but we must refrain from
indulging in anticipations. The manner of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
John's leave-taking, had struck, with no little
amazement, all those who saw him. Mrs.
Rainsfield was the one, who, conjecturing its
cause, could best appreciate his feelings; she
pitied him, and secretly determined, that if
he and Eleanor were to be for ever separated,
it should not be for want of strategy on her
part. She felt that not only his happiness,
but the girl's too, depended upon their union;
and she considered her husband had taken
too strict a notion of the engagement with
Smithers, who, she believed, thought very little
of it: therefore, Mrs. Rainsfield concluded,
very little man&oelig;uvring would break it off;
and so determined to devote her energies to
such a consummation.</p>

</div>

<p>That portion of the year to which we now
bring our narrative is, without exception, the
finest period of Australian seasons; when
the temperature is the <i>acme</i> of salubrity, and
the climate, generally, as delightful as can be
imagined. We speak of the spring when
merging into the early summer, and when the
cool freshness of the morning breeze tempers the
genial warmth of the mid-day sun; which had
acquired just sufficient strength in his rays to
impart a pleasant heat without oppressiveness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
On such a morning, then, when the vast
concave of the heavens, expanded in a perfectly
spotless azure sky (such as in our foggy
isle is never seen); and with the freshness of
the bush developing its verdure in the odorous
exudations of floriferous plants, and the
blithesome exuberance of the songless denizens
of nature's nemoral aviary; William took
his departure on the mission we have detailed
in the last chapter.</p>

<p>He journeyed on for days, singly but not
lonely; for his heart was inspired by the
lambent fragrance of nature's smile; and he
felt not the solitude of the road, as he
travelled over the vast expanse of the Darling
Downs. He had traversed this vast table-land,
and was approaching its eastern margin,
where the descent was to be made to the
coast country, when he began to experience
an oppressiveness in the atmosphere, which he
knew portended a storm. He, however, continued
his course, though, indeed, he had no
option, until, as the sun was approaching the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
meridian, he entered the deep gorge called
Cunningham's Gap, through which the road
passed to the low country, and looked
anxiously at the lowering aspect of the sky.
He felt he might make up his mind for a
drenching in the approaching storm, which
he perceived would soon burst over his head;
and only exerted himself to get through "the
Gap" into open land, before it commenced.</p>

<p>Cunningham's Gap, or, as for the sake of
brevity it is generally called, "the Gap," is
situated between fifty and sixty miles from
the coast; and is, as its name would imply, a
defile in the mountains, affording a convenient
passage through the "main range;" or more
properly speaking, a descent from the table-land
of the Darling Downs to the country
below. The descent effected by this pass is
between two and three thousand feet; and the
view obtained in the passage of the low lying
country is beautiful in the extreme. The
gorge itself is one of those combinations of the
picturesque and sublime with the useful; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
viewed as a specimen of scenery, it is surpassingly
grand. Looking at it in its ascent, where
its two stupendous sides raise their gigantic
masses in rocky precipices, upwards of two
thousand feet high; which seem to frown
upon the bold traveller who ventures within
their cavernous precincts; one cannot contemplate
the vast fissure other than as the work
of a beneficent providence, as a gateway in the
otherwise insurmountable "range."</p>

<p>William Ferguson had entered the "Gap,"
and was riding down the declivity at a rapid
rate, when the sky became still more overcast,
and the clouds gathered in quick
succession; while the low fulminating of
the distant thunder, and the death-like
stillness of the defile, indicated the speedy
approach of the storm, and imparted a
solemnity to the scene. The thunder became
more distinct. The lightning flashed in vivid
darts, which seemed to play along the sides of
the pass, until the attractive adamant deviated
the refrangible fluid; which then buried it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>self
in some deep crevice of the pendent rocks.
A few heavy drops of rain then fell to the
earth, and were speedily succeeded by a
deluge, which was driven on the face of a
tempest almost irresistible. Still on sped the
rider almost carried on the wings of the storm;
until he was relieved from any pressing
anxiety by emerging on the plain; while the
elemental warfare raged with unabated fury.</p>

<p>William, now relieved from apprehension,
proceeded leisurely on the road, which he
had to travel for some miles until he reached
an inn; but, as he began to feel extremely
uncomfortable, to sooner reach the shelter of a
roof, he determined to accelerate his speed.
With this intention, he clapped spurs to his
horse and went off at a sharp pace, until he
came to a track that emerged at an acute
angle from the road. At this spot he hesitated
for a moment; but, believing it to be
the road leading to Rosehall, the station of a
gentleman with whom he was distantly
acquainted; and as night would be shortly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
closing in, while he had a long distance to go
before he reached the inn; he decided upon
intruding on the hospitality of his friend. He
therefore turned his horse's head into the path,
and rode off again at a brisk pace. As he
proceeded, however, the road became somewhat
indistinct; and at last all appearance of
a track vanished; leaving our friend involved
in the bush without the semblance of a path,
or appearance of any habitation in the vicinity.
By this time William discovered his mistake
in taking this path (which appeared only to
be a bullock track) for the road to Rosehall;
and his only alternative was to find his way
back again to the road he had left. To do
this, however, he did not fancy retracing his
steps; and, there being very little time for
speculation, he determined to make a short
cut through the bush in the direction he knew
the main road must run.</p>

<p>His resolution was soon formed, and as
speedily acted upon; for the idea no sooner
entered his mind than he plunged into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
bush without any further consideration; and
continued his course until his progress was
stopped by the intervention of a seemingly
impenetrable scrub. The sight of this impediment
by no means tended to animate him
with pleasant or amiable feelings; for he knew,
if he was compelled to deviate from his course,
his chance of reaching the road before night
would be very remote; and, if he did not
succeed in doing that, he saw no option but
to make a nocturnal sojourn in the bush;
the idea of which, all things considered, he
did not much like. To extricate himself from
this difficulty, he skirted the scrub, both up and
down, for an opening through which to penetrate;
until at last he perceived an aperture,
into which he darted, though only to find
after a short progress, a still further stoppage;
and this time one of a more unpleasant
nature.</p>

<p>At his feet ran a creek, swollen by the rains
into a deep and rapid stream. To skirt its
banks, to ascertain the direction in which it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
flowed, was impossible; for, with the exception
of the spot on which he stood (and where it
seemed broader and shallower than elsewhere),
it was lined by the scrub. Beyond the stream
was the direction he wished to go to reach the
road, but this fluvial barrier stopped his progress;
and he saw no other course, if he wished
to attain his goal, than to swim the flood. For
a few moments he gazed upon the dark waters
of the creek, as they hurried on their turbid
volume sullenly and quietly; and knew that
to cross them, he had to swim a current that
might prove too strong for him to stem;
besides the numerous eddies and hidden
dangers that they might contain. His heart
had some misgivings at the venture; nevertheless,
he was aware, if he was to reach
shelter that night, the passage of the creek
had to be effected. The momentary sensation
of fear gave place to the excitement of braving
hazard; and its danger was speedily forgotten
in the contemplation of a night's bivouac
under a tree; and with the consciousness of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
being a good swimmer, and a familiarity with
such predicaments, he rode his horse to the
edge of the stream, and urged him into it.</p>

<p>Often do the instincts of the lower animals
prompt them to an avoidance of danger, where
the rasher nature of man impels him towards
his doom. For some time the animal which
William rode&mdash;standing on the margin of the
water, with his nose close to it, seemingly to
ascertain the nature of the element into which
his master wished him to plunge&mdash;snorted and
paced the ground with a degree of impatience,
that plainly showed he did not like the task
required of him. He was not long, however,
permitted to hesitate; there was no escape
from the passage; the creek had to be crossed,
while no other way presented itself but to
swim; so, upon a fresh admonition from his
rider, the animal entered the water, and
gallantly breasted the stream.</p>

<p>As the horse took the flood, William quietly
slid off the saddle into the water, and keeping a
hold of one of the stirrups, easily swam by his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
side. The noble animal, in a case like this, required
no guiding hand to direct him; his instinct
told him, his master's object was to reach
the other bank; and he, therefore, swam direct
for the point desired. For a few seconds the
quadruped and his owner kept on "the even
tenor of their way," and William congratulated
himself on the favourable prospect of his crossing;
until they got more into the force of the
current, when he found it almost overwhelming.
He, however, struggled hard; while,
alternately, he was almost swept from his hold
by the force of the stream, and nearly
separated from his trusty steed by the vortex
of an eddy. But these difficulties were
trifling compared to the one that awaited
him.</p>

<p>He had reached about the middle of the
creek, when he perceived, with consternation,
the immense trunk of a tree floating down the
stream, with all the fearful velocity of the
current; and in an instant his mind comprehended
the danger of his perilous position.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
The tree was one, evidently, which had been
long lying on the bank of the creek; and had
been dislodged, and carried off, as the water
had risen in the present flood. From its long
recubation, it had become divested of its bark,
foliage, and smaller branches; leaving only its
knarled trunk and concomitant adjuncts, its
crural like limbs. As it approached the swimmers,
it presented nothing to view, but the long
surface of its trunk, which floated supinely in
the water; at the same time rushing on with
irresistible force, and having its branches concealed
beneath the surface of the flood. The
stout heart of young Ferguson almost sickened
at the sight; however, he braced his nerves for
a struggle, and urged his faithful horse to its
utmost, to escape the proximity of their dangerous
neighbour.</p>

<p>On it came, closer and closer, still watched
by the anxious eye of William; until he
thought (as it almost reached him, angrily
muttering, with the subdued murmur of the
flood, its disappointed expectations of a victim)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
that he was safe. But his self-gratulation, at
this moment, was very inopportune; for, just
as he uttered an exclamation of thankfulness
at his supposed escape, the tree approached the
broad and shallower part of the creek; when,
suddenly throwing its upper end into the air
with a convulsive leap, it threatened utter
destruction to the two devoted and struggling
objects in the water. For a moment it seemed
poised; but, losing its equilibrium, it fell obliquely
into the stream, covering William and
his horse with the blinding spray; and before
they could regain their sight, the huge
mass swang round with the current, and
entirely submerging them, swept them off
with the flood, as they were almost reaching
the bank.</p>

<p>The cause of this grotesque man&oelig;uvre on
the part of the tree, we will here explain. In
approaching the broader and, consequently,
shallower part of the stream, its course had
been arrested, by one of its sunken branches
coming in contact, and burying itself, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
soft bed of the creek. The log, therefore, with
the impetus it had gained in its transit, thus
suddenly brought to a stand, momentarily
reared its head; but almost instantly losing its
equipoise, fell again sideways into the stream;
while the branch being still imbedded in the
soft mud of the bottom, the trunk naturally
described a circle; and to all appearances
annihilated William and his horse.</p>

<p>Some time after this, how long he had not
a remote idea, William, upon returning to
consciousness, found himself stretched upon
the bank of the creek; while the shades of
night were fast closing in around him. What
he had experienced he shuddered to think of;
though every circumstance attending his late
danger, and providential escape, segregated
itself from the chaotic mass in his brain, and
laid before him a panorama of his ordeal. In
his mind, he had distinct visions, of having
been, as it were, grasped with a rough hand
by the watery element, and drawn by the
demon of the flood to the depths of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
cavernous home; while the hissing of the
water, which seemed to him at the time to
rush into his very soul, still sounded in his
ears. To the fearful sensation of oppression
and smothering that first weighed in his heart,
succeeded a calm and tranquil sleep; from
which he was aroused, by a repetition of the
noises of rushing waters in his ears; and the
sensation of the horrors of a mundane dissolution
filled his mind. At that moment, his head
came in violent contact with some object;
which, on the impulse of the moment, he
clutched with a drowning grasp; while with
the friendly aid of the pendent branch of a
tree, he had an indistinct recollection of
drawing himself from the water, and alighting
on the ground; where he sank in a state of
utter insensibility. How long he remained
in that state, he was unable to conjecture;
but he awoke with a feeling of sickness, which
weighed heavily on his heart; and with his
limbs perfectly benumbed and almost paralysed
(thankful for the manifest interposition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
of providence), with a painful effort he arose.
He then went to search for his horse, to see if
the faithful animal had been as fortunate as
himself; and had not proceeded far ere he
espied him, still standing trembling from the
fear, from which he had hardly recovered.</p>

<p>To reach the inn that night was hopeless;
in fact, to proceed at all, William felt was
almost impossible, for both he and his horse
were perfectly knocked up; while he was so
unnerved and dispirited, that he hardly knew
which way to turn. To remain where he was,
however, was not to be thought of; for setting
aside the discomfort of his position, the
danger was imminent. The rain continued
to fall in a deluge, and the land on which he
stood being low, if the creek rose much more
(which was very probable), the flat would be
soon covered with water. He had no alternative,
then, but to drag on his weary limbs, and
lead his worn-out horse, to either some hospitable
shelter, or a more auspicious locality
to camp in. Before resuming his journey,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
he gave two or three vociferous "cooeys,"
but without hearing any answering sound,
save the echo of his own voice. He then
crawled along, in the direction which he
imagined the road must be in, in the hope
of falling in with some cheering prospect;
but after toiling for about half an hour, the
consternation with which he witnessed the
effectual stoppage of his further progress, by
another stream, fairly overcame him; and he
sank exhausted to the ground.</p>

<p>The sagacious animal, that had borne the
young man through many a difficulty, and
who stood over the prostrate body of his
master, showed his concern for him by many
little signs of emotion, and at last brought
William to an application of his energies, by
causing him to notice his movements.
William then raised his languid frame; and
with drooping spirits, gazed on the fresh obstacle
before him. He perceived it had a current,
running opposite to that which he had
lately crossed; and then the truth flashed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
across his mind, that it must be another bend
of the same creek, forming a pocket of the land
on which he was standing. He now perceived
that, by a slight deviation from his course, he
might have avoided the crossing which had
nearly cost him his life; though now it was
evident, to reach his destination, he would
have to cross it again. Not wishing, however,
to risk his life a second time in so short an
interval; and feeling himself perfectly inadequate
to the task, even if he desired it; he
determined to follow the creek up its course,
in the hope of meeting with shelter of some
sort. He therefore resumed his weary travelling,
skirting the bank of the stream; and occasionally
"cooeying," to ascertain if any
human being was within hearing.</p>

<p>Thus he had proceeded for some time, perfectly
disheartened and almost desponding,
when he espied on a little knoll, a short
distance from the creek, a small slab hut.
Humble and untenable as the refuge appeared,
no shipwrecked mariner, with the prospect of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
being rescued from a watery grave, by the opportune
assistance of some life-boat, did ever
hail his deliverance with greater joy and
gratitude, than did William the sight of this
"humpie." It looked uninhabited and perfectly
deserted; but still, wretched as it appeared,
it promised shelter for himself and his
beast; and would enable him in all probability
to make a fire and refresh his weary limbs.
At the same time he knew that, even if the
place were deserted, there would be sure to be
some signs of settlement near, and possibly a
track to the head station of the run on which
it was situated.</p>

</div>

<p>It was then with a gladdened heart that
William approached the hut, which was of
dimensions little larger than a good-sized dog
kennel; and when he reached the aperture that
served for an entrance, and gazed at the interior,
he was not a little surprised to find that
it was habited, though the inhabitant was not
visible. The interior was as miserable looking
as could be imagined; the floor, or rather
the ground on which it stood, was covered with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
as much water as the earth outside; and the
slabs, which formed its walls, had shrunk with
their exposure to the sun and weather since
they had been first put together, and left long
and narrow interstices between each, through
which the rain driven by the wind, and the
water on the ground in perfect streams, were
permitted, <i>ad libitum</i>, to make their ingress.
In the centre of the domicile, and seemingly
firmly fixed into the ground, were four sticks,
so placed as to form the four corners of a
parallelogram; their ends were forked, and
held two other sticks about six feet long, resting
longitudinally in their supports. To each
of these side poles were affixed, with small
skewer-like twigs, the sides of a sack which
had been cut open lengthways; and formed
in all, an impromptu bedstead or stretcher, on
which, by a bundle of blankets that there appeared,
it was evident the occupier of the
establisment was wont to court repose, free
from the moisture of his mother earth. Under
this rural bed, was a box of that description<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
generally brought to the country by emigrants,
and at once proclaimed its owner, to the
practised eye of William, to be a "new chum;"
for he well knew that after a very short
residence in the country such cumbrous attendants
were usually dispensed with&mdash;shepherds
who had gained much experience usually
carrying their extensive wardrobes on their
backs, and their blankets and pots rolled up
in their "swags."</p>

<p>As we have said, William at once knew the
rural swain, whose habitation this was, to be
one new to the colony; and he readily conjectured
his absence from his abode was
occasioned by some detention incidental to
the storm, and which his experience had
not taught him to avoid. Before the
door of the hut lay a few sticks and logs
charred by fire, the relics of a conflagration;
ignited, probably, for culinary purposes, as
well as to impart caloric to the person of the
shepherd. Knowing these to be less pervious
to the wet than unburnt wood, William<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
laid them in order for burning, in a position
as free from water as he could find; and after
stripping the flakey bark off some tea trees
(the inner part of which is generally dry
and exceedingly inflammable), he speedily
managed, as only bushmen can, to ignite a
fire; and had it in a cheerful blaze, as the rain
subsided and the occupant of the hut made
his appearance. Somewhat refreshed by the
genial warmth of the fire, and the prospect
of having some tea and something to eat,
William soon forgot his fatigue and late
dangers; and when the man reached his
place, rather surprised at the appearance of a
stranger, our friend had taken the bridle and
saddle from his horse, hobbled him, and
turned him out too feed; and was comfortably
seated at the fire, watching the water boil in
the shepherd's tin pot, preparatory to infusing
his tea.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the intrusion were
soon explained by young Ferguson; and in
a few minutes he and the shepherd were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
socially seated at the fire, discussing their
evening meal of salt meat, tea, and "damper;"
and were pleasantly conversing together, as if
they had been boon companions from their
youth. From this man William learnt that
he had entirely gone out of his way; and
that in the morning his best plan would be
not to attempt to regain the road in the way
he had lost it, but to take the track that led
from the stock-yard in the vicinity to the
head station; whence he would find a well-beaten
line to the main road. His informant
said he believed the road lay not far off; but
he could not say how far, nor in what precise
direction; and should, therefore, recommend
him, for greater certainty and security, to go
by the more circuitous way of the head station.
William admired this cautionary advice, and
determined on the following morning to act
upon it in preference to submitting himself to
the ordeal of another swimming; more especially
as the station on which he then was,
was Rosehall, the place he had desired to find.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>In the course of their conversation, William
had elicited from the shepherd some little
information respecting himself; which we
may be pardoned, for the sake of information,
for inserting here. He had only been in the
colony about six months; and had been hired
by his present employer direct from the ship
in which he had emigrated, and brought at
once up to the station; where for some time
he felt acutely the hardships of his situation;
though he had gradually become inured to
them, and was then perfectly contented. When
he arrived on the station the weather was
fearfully wet; and he had been put into the
hut he then occupied, and given the charge
of a flock of sheep, which he was left to tend
in perfect solitude. Added to this, the discomfort
of his home (if he could have called it
by such a term), perfectly sickened him of the
country, and he heartily wished himself back
again in England; regretting the day he
had ever been induced to leave it. Rolled
in his blankets, he used at night to lay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
down on the damp ground, to contract
rheumatisms and numerous other ailments;
while his rations and everything about him
were continually saturated; and to make up the
catalogue of his troubles, he, on more than one
occasion, lost himself in the bush. Now, however,
he said, he had got used to all these inconveniences;
which, after all (from the
rarity of their occurrence), he considered slight;
and as to the wet, since he had been put up
to the dodge of keeping his bed dry, it did not
concern him in the least. He liked the independence
of his life, though it was a little dull;
and his wages being good, he was enabled to
save plenty of money; while he intended to
be removed to the head station, when, he said,
he would be perfectly contented with his lot.</p>

<p>The morning following the storm broke calm
and beautiful; the air was clear and fresh, and
a serenity was diffused abroad, perfectly enchanting;
while the exhilarating buoyancy of
the atmosphere, and its refreshing temperature,
fully compensated for the previous visitation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
William, as we would say here, rose with the
lark; and having brought in his horse, saddled
and mounted him, and after bidding adieu to
his rustic entertainer, from whom he received
directions about the road to the station, "he
went him on his winding way."</p>

<p>After following the directions of the shepherd,
in about an hour or so he approached
Rosehall, and presented himself to the inmates
as they were about sitting down to breakfast.
Upon the relation to them of his adventure,
he had the satisfaction to learn, that if he
had skirted the scrub for a short distance, until
he came to the bend of the creek that formed
the pocket, in which he found himself after
swimming it, he would have been able to
have struck the road in a few minutes. However,
by the time he received this information,
it was of little use to him; and having entirely
lost all thought of his past danger, he could
laugh with his friends at the absurdity of
losing himself in the bush. He remained at
Rosehall a few hours longer than he intended,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
at the solicitation of his friend Mr Lauray;
who was deeply interested in a question that
was then agitating the whole population of
Moreton Bay; and which we will take the
liberty of explaining.</p>

<p>Some few years previous to the date of this
incident, a small party, feeling the injustice
and neglect under which the district had so
long suffered, introduced the idea of applying
to the Crown for the separation of the northern
portion of New South Wales from the parent
colony; and its erection into a separate state,
with the free exercise of its own legislation.
The movement at first gained little favour; as
in the infant state of the district, it was thought
premature, if not preposterous. But that
immortal colonial agitator, the Rev. Dr. Lang,
declaring himself an advocate for separation;
and forcibly aiding the scheme with his pen,
and indefatigable exertions, the party continued
to gather strength until it had assumed
a bold attitude, reiterating its demands to the
throne. To give the reader some notion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
the subject, we will endeavour to transcribe
such of the conversation at Rosehall as will
serve to enlighten him.</p>

<p>"I shall want you, Mr. Ferguson, now you
are here," said the proprietor of the place,
"to affix your signature to a petition to the
Queen, praying for the separation of these
districts from New South Wales."</p>

<p>"I am not yet convinced," replied William,
"that the district will be benefited by being
separated."</p>

<p>"I don't think," replied the other, "it will
take much argument to convince you, or any
other rational being, that separation would not
only be beneficial, but is absolutely necessary
for the welfare of Moreton Bay. In the first
place, we are not adequately represented in
the Assembly; and, in the next, five to six
hundred miles is too great a distance to be
removed from the seat of government. Even
if the ministry had the desire to do us justice,
their unacquaintance with our wants would
prevent their inclinations from being of any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
service to us; though I am not disposed to
think, from our past experience, that any
Sydney batch of legislators, would be at all
inclined to give us any consideration. The
revenue derivable from the districts, is
annually swept into the Sydney treasury;
and I would ask, with what return? Why
absolutely nothing! They amount in this district
alone, I have no hesitation in saying, to
considerably over &pound;150,000; while, with the
exception of a few salaries, paid to some
almost useless officials, and a few hundreds
voted occasionally for our roads, just to remind
us that we are not entirely forgotten, we get
no return. Look at our towns in the country;
whenever the exchequer is in need of a little
ready money, they put up sufficient land in
our district to replenish their coffers, and to
make the inhabitants feel the desire and
necessity for more. It has always been the
policy of our rulers to keep the demand for
land in excess of the supply, by which means
they create a spirited competition, and establish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
a fictitious value. Hence, these towns are each
drained of some thousands of pounds annually;
while the streets are permitted, by the powers
that be, to remain in their primeval state,
either to become impassable, or dangerous to
the limbs and lives of the inhabitants."</p>

<p>"There certainly may be some little neglect
on the part of the government," replied William;
"but surely a district, with so limited a
population as this, will with difficulty bear
the expense of a separate executive?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Mr. Lauray, "our income
is perfectly adequate; in fact it exceeds that
of many an older state: besides we should
have the satisfaction of expending it ourselves,
and should not require to be continually demanding
(but rarely receiving) money from
the government for such necessary works as
bridges and roads. The present state of our
main lines of traffic is perfectly scandalous;
and if we should remain a portion of New
South Wales until doomsday, I believe they
wouldn't be put into an efficient state."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>"Well, but," replied William, "I imagine we
can only expect the expenditure of our share
of public money; and if all the districts get
their proportions, what more can we desire?"</p>

<p>"But I deny," replied the other, "that we
are getting anything like our proportion, or
any proportion at all. The public revenue is
mainly swallowed up in works that do not at
all affect the country districts; such as the
public buildings in Sydney, and the harbour
improvements there. Notice the colonial
debt of between two and three millions, and
say how was it contracted? Was it not in
the construction of Sydney sewers, Sydney
water-works, and the Sydney railway? And
for these, from which we shall never receive the
slightest benefit, we have not only had our
revenue appropriated for years, but have to sustain
the impost of higher duties, to provide
for the interest of this fund."</p>

<p>"Still," replied William, "I think it is only
just, we should contribute our share of the public
expenditure in the machinery of government."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>"Granted!" said Lauray, "but city improvements
do not in any way come under
that head. The improvement of the district
is much, if not altogether retarded, by the
continual neglect at head quarters. There are
certain public works, the necessity for which
is severely felt, and even acknowledged by
the government itself to be highly desirable;
but to every application of ours for the
necessary money, we are met by the cool assertion,
that they have none to give us. Can
you imagine anything more unjust than this;
after the application of our own funds to
purposes foreign to our interests, when we
demand the expenditure of a small sum upon
our own districts, to be informed that the
money has been expended? We do not desire
separation for the mere pleasure of being our
own masters; but for the purpose of having,
more effectually, a voice in the distribution
of our revenue. If we had received more
attention and justice from the government
in past years, we should never have agitated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
separation; but now we feel it essentially
indispensable, and separation we must have.
You are no doubt aware the Queen in council
has reserved to herself the right of dismemberment
of these districts, whenever the wishes of
the inhabitants should render it necessary;
and now we do not intend letting the question
rest, until we have attained our object.
We have already forwarded many prayers to
the throne; and at this moment petitions are
travelling the length and breadth of the
country to obtain signatures. The opposition
we shall receive from New South Wales, I
believe, will be strenuous; but the present size
of that colony, nearly half that of Europe, is
perfectly preposterous, and renders the equitable
administration of the laws, in so vast a
territory and with the seat of government so
isolated, perfectly impossible. I am aware, that
the revenue of the parent colony will be very
much crippled by the separate erection of her
offshoot; and her burdens will be consequently
heavier on her inhabitants. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
because her legislators have, through a reckless
system of extravagance, impoverished and
run their country into debt, that is no reason
why we should also be bound down to her in
her depression. I know many condemn the
desire of the Moreton Bay people to relieve
themselves from the embarrassment of New
South Wales; and state it is selfish and derogatory
in us attempting to repudiate our share
of the debt, and after being benefited by her
prosperity in past years, to desire separation
now, when her resources are more circumscribed.
But I believe the obligation is the other way:
Sydney has been drawing her prosperity in a
great measure from these districts; for the
trade that has existed between us has been of
greater benefit and more advantageous to
her people than to us; and as for their
debt, we are in no way liable for any portion
of it."</p>

<p>It is needless for us to trace this conversation
any further; as doubtless, by this time,
our reader will have formed some conception<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
of the "separation question." Suffice it to
say, that though William, owing to his having
been living on the New South Wales side of
the proposed boundary, had heard very little
of it, and that only to its prejudice, it was a
subject which absorbed the general attention
of the Moreton Bay community; and he,
becoming impregnated with the same feeling,
left Rosehall a convert to the popular cry.</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival in town, he selected
the furniture and other things required on
the station; and making arrangement with
his agent for their despatch by the return of
the dray which was bringing down the wool,
he turned his face to his father's house, and in
due time reached New England, without the
occurrence of any fresh adventure.</p>

<p>"I am so pleased that you have come, dear
Willie," cried the blooming and cheerful Kate,
as she threw herself into William's arms when
he alighted from his horse at the door; "we
have been expecting you for some days, and
began to think you had taken flight in some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
other direction. I am so anxious to hear all
about your doings, and to know all those kind
people, whose acquaintance you have made;
particularly those near you, whom John says
I am to stay with. Are they nice people,
Willie? but I am sure they must be, or you
wouldn't like them; but do tell me what sort
of a girl Miss Rainsfield is? John says so
many fine things about her; that she is a
perfect angel, and all that sort of thing; and
that he has no doubt that, if I only have
sufficient good sense as to take her as my
pattern, I will derive much benefit from my
visit. The impudent fellow, what does he
mean by that, Will?"</p>

<p>"I don't know his precise motives, my little
seraph," replied William; "probably he thinks
her quiet and serious manner would well accord
with his own little sister's nature; in preference
to her volatile and spirited character;
and that her calm and dignified manner,
would suit you well in your new capacity of
housekeeper. But I can support his opinion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
that she is an amiable and charming creature;
and I strongly suspect that he is somewhat
smitten with her."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'll tease him dreadfully for
giving me such a horrid lesson," exclaimed
Kate; "I can't be always serious like his
Dulciana; besides I don't think it so nice, do
you, Will?"</p>

<p>"I don't indeed, my dear, in your case at
least," replied he; "for I think it would spoil
you to try and check your spirits; but there
is one thing I must entreat of you to remember,
you foolish little thing. Although John
has said nothing to me about his feelings
towards Miss Rainsfield; as I have already
told you, I strongly suspect he is over head
and ears in love with her; but for his sake
you must not lightly mention her name, or
the subject of his feelings; for, if he is enamoured
of her, I fear he is doomed to disappointment.
I understand she is already engaged;
though her cousin tells me, he does not think
she cares much for her betrothed; and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
he intends attempting to prevent her from
throwing herself away in the manner she contemplates.
Still, I fancy any mention of the
subject to John would pain him, so we must
be silent. Now tell me, my pet, what I have
done to be left standing outside my father's
house? may I not be permitted to walk in."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me," exclaimed the girl, "I never
thought I was keeping you on the verandah;
but, come along, mamma will be so glad to see
you; I don't think she knows you've come,
for I was the only one who caught sight of
you. But, Willie, do you know Mr. Wigton
is stopping with us just now, and he has been
kind enough to promise to accompany us?"
saying which, without waiting for any further
remark from her brother, she tripped lightly
into the house; followed by William, after he
had delivered his horse to one of the men.</p>

<p>As we have already, in our opening chapter,
introduced the reader to the Ferguson family
at Acacia Creek, we may be pardoned for omitting
a similar ceremony now; but of Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Wigton, who was at the time a visitor in the
house, it may be necessary to say a few words.</p>

<p>He was a clergyman of the Wesleyan persuasion;
one of the old Methodist leaven; an
earnest and devout man, and a conscientious
Christian: one who was kind and benevolent
in his disposition, and without that bigotry
and uncharitableness so prevalent among some
of the rigid bodies of religionists. His piety
was such, as to induce him, in the work of his
Master, to forget all private interests, endure
privation and fatigue, and to carry the consolations
of religion into the remotest corner
of the bush. He fulfilled, to the extent of his
power, the injunctions of his Saviour, when
He said, "Go ye into all the world and preach
the gospel to every creature;" and while he
received disappointments and misfortunes
with exemplary patience and unflinching
courage, he persevered in his course, with an
energy worthy of the cause. In his corporeal
capacity, to judge from his appearance, he was
ill calculated to sustain the continual exer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>tions
incumbent on his vocation; and yet he
performed them with an alacrity truly surprising.
He was of the middle height; rather
slim in figure, apparently delicate in his constitution,
fair complexioned; and a bachelor
of about thirty-five years of age. He had
refused various solicitations from congregations,
to accept of a residentiary charge, and
had devoted himself to the missionary's work,
where the presence of a spiritual teacher was
much wanted.</p>

<p>He had perceived that hundreds upon
hundreds of square miles in the bush, in fact
almost all the country districts, were destitute
of a ministry of any creed or denomination;
and he had, with an earnest zeal and
devoted piety, undertaken the task of
administering to the spiritual wants of the
bushmen. Never since the days of the old
apostles, had a work of such magnitude been
attempted by a single-handed man; and any
heart less stout, or enthusiasm less genuine,
than that of the Rev. Mr. Wigton, would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
speedily sank under a load of mortification, at
the difficulties that beset his path. In a
country where the Sabbath is almost entirely
forgotten; where on that sacred day the
country stores exhibit their wares for sale,
and the public-houses resound with the shouts
of drunken revelry; where the servant is
frequently punished, for refusing to obey his
master's commands to its desecration; where
blasphemy and sacrilege, in which master vies
with man, is constantly heard; and where
ignorance and vice stalk triumphant through
the land,&mdash;some conception may be formed of
the stupendous nature of the reform to be
effected.</p>

<p>Thanks to such as this messenger of peace,
much good has now been accomplished. Bad
as it is, the Sabbath is better observed than
formerly, not only in the townships but on
the stations; and depravity is on the wane.
But, at the time of which we write, the
state of moral darkness was as great as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>any heathenism extant. To the work of
enlightenment, had Mr. Wigton sanctified
himself; and his name had already become
revered, in many places in the solitude of the
bush, where he had been the instrument of
bringing grace to his benighted countrymen.
At the same time, he had not neglected the
case of the black. He had with considerable
difficulty, acquired a pretty accurate knowledge
of their language and customs; and he
preached the glad tidings to them, whenever
an opportunity presented itself. His present
intention was to accompany William with his
sister, on their journey to Fern Vale; and,
while spending some little time with them

<p>When we left John Ferguson after his
departure from Strawberry Hill, we attempted
to depict his feelings; as well as the motives
which influenced the minds of the Rainsfield
ladies. In the resumption of our narrative,
we will follow our hero in the continuance
of his mental aberration. His misery and
dejection were intense; and such were his
sufferings, that he moved about his station a
mere shadow of his former self, and kept him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>self
exclusively to his own place; attempting
to relieve his feelings by engrossing his mind
on his avocation. Tom Rainsfield, in the
meantime, had learnt from his sister-in-law
the cause of John's estrangement; and deeply
sympathising with his friend, he made his
visits to Fern Vale as frequent as possible, to
cheer and enliven him in his dullness. Tom
imagined if he could but induce him to banish
his despondency, he would be enabled to make
him feel there was a chance of his succeeding
in overcoming Eleanor's scruples in breaking
faith with Smithers; by inducing her to look
favourably upon his addresses. At the same
time, he felt the delicacy of his task; for he
had no warrant, on which to ground his assumption
of his friend's attachment; though
(notwithstanding that John Ferguson had not
breathed to a creature his love for Eleanor)
he was perfectly convinced, he was irretrievably
lost in the passion. Whether or not
Tom had been enlisted into the services of his
sister-in-law, we will not stop to consider; or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
in fact can we pretend to say; though, from
the earnestness with which he proceeded with
his scheme, we are led to imagine that, possibly
stimulated by his own inclinations, he
was, nevertheless, acting under the guidance
of that astute and pertinent directress. He
had laid down certain plans for operation;
and had so far succeeded in their execution,
as to induce John Ferguson to lend the aid
he had on a former occasion promised to Mr.
Rainsfield, in the erection of a bridge over the
Wombi; and to proceed himself to the river,
and assist in its construction.</p>

<p>The house at Fern Vale was by this time
finished, and the carpenters who had been
employed in its erection were consequently
disengaged. This was considered a good
opportunity by Tom Rainsfield; and the men
were forthwith despatched to the Wombi, to
assist in the construction of the bridge. On
the appointed day, John met Mr. Rainsfield
and Tom at the scene of action, and work was
at once commenced.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>They first selected the two largest trees on
the bank of the river; and after attaching
strong ropes to their trunks, to guard against
their falling into the stream, and thus elude
their destiny, they felled them. Their next
arrangement, after clearing the stems of their
branches, was to make them span the creek;
which being accomplished they left the carpenters
to do the rest. This was to strengthen
and support the beams, by erecting upright
pieces as buttresses at the edge of the stream,
so as, not only to keep the fallen trees firmly
fixed, but to give them additional power to
sustain weight. After this the men were to
make a flooring, by firmly fixing across the
main trunks some stout saplings, and cover it
with earth, which would complete, what our
friends considered would be, a very serviceable
structure.</p>

<p>The young men, after they had accomplished
the task of getting the logs to span the creek,
as we have said, left the carpenters to complete
the work; while they took their depar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>ture
from the spot, and turned home. Here
John Ferguson essayed to leave his friends;
but that they would not hear of. Tom, especially,
was loud in declaiming against such a
course; declaring that the ladies would be
justly offended when they knew that he had
been at Strawberry Hill without calling upon
them. "You may just as well drop in," he
said, "and dine with us, and I will ride over
to Fern Vale with you in the evening."</p>

<p>To this invitation John could offer no
reasonable objection; and not wishing it to
be imagined that he entertained any disrespect
for Mrs. Rainsfield, he wavered in his rigid
determination to absent himself; while his
friends were the more pressing for him to accompany
them; and at last all further parley
was ended by Tom turning the heads of the
horses towards the house, and constraining his
companion to follow him.</p>

<p>When the party rode up to the station, they
left their horses at the stable, and walked into
the house, at the entrance of which they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
met by Mrs. Rainsfield. John she at once
attacked for his past coolness and unneighbourly
conduct in abstaining from ever calling
upon her; and he, when he had entered the
parlour, and was met by Eleanor with just
sufficient confusion and reserve to make her
more than ever interesting, and with a
warmth that quite overcame him, felt the old
fire in his heart burning with redoubled fury.
But when she exclaimed, "Really, Mr. Ferguson
we had quite relinquished the idea of ever
seeing you again, you have so long estranged
yourself from our society;" and continued, "I
can't think you could have taken any offence
at anything we may have done or said; but
if so, upon your mentioning it, we will endeavour
to make the <i>amende honorable</i>,"&mdash;he
was perfectly reclaimed from his "slough
of despond." At the same time he knew he
could make no explanation, and therefore kept
silent. What was he to do? he was again enslaved
as hopelessly as ever; for the charm
of Eleanor's presence he could not resist. How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
could he act a part of coldness or indifference,
when she enchanted him with her kindest
manner, and gladdened his heart with her
sweetest smile? At that moment he made a
determination which seemed to alter his whole
manner, and infuse new life into his spirits;
what that determination was, gentle reader,
thou shalt shortly know by his actions. The
thought passed through his mind, as the transient
cloud flits across the face of the sun;
it thawed the ice-bound ligaments of his heart,
and gave him utterance in the following remark:</p>

<p>"I am afraid I am indeed a truant, Miss
Rainsfield, and ought therefore to make my
apologies due on my neglect; but it would be
useless in my attempting to exonerate, or even
excuse myself; so I will throw myself on your
clemency, and crave your interpretation of my
abandonment, in the most charitable light."</p>

<p>This speech of John's, if it were uttered
designedly, was a masterpiece. To Mr. Rainsfield
it had an air of flippancy that indicated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
to him a total suppression of any tender feeling;
and he congratulated himself that his
young friend had had sufficient good sense to
see the justice of his remarks to him with
respect to Eleanor. To Mrs. Rainsfield it
appeared in a different light; she detected in
it a warmth that sprung spontaneously from
the heart; and from it she argued favourably
of the success of her schemes, and the happiness
of her friends. To Eleanor it was
mysterious; whether it was that it was the
first time John had attempted anything
in the shape of flattery to her, and that
she felt surprised; or that her vanity was
pleased with the flattery, we cannot say. Bear
with us, gentle reader, when we make the
allusion, for how perfect soever a woman may
be, she is not completely devoid of vanity;
and chaste and innocent as was our Eleanor,
it was possible for her to receive a thrill
of pleasure, at hearing a well-directed compliment
from one whom she respected; believing
it to be uttered with an expression of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
something more than mere idle coquetry. Or,
it may be, a certain truth flashed across her
mind; but certain it is that, when she heard
it, the blush mantled her fair cheek, and she
turned away her head. To Tom it was the
source of rejoicing; for he did not consider
whether the speech was expressive of genuine
or assumed sentiment, but simply noticed in
it a return of his friend to his former self.</p>

<p>Such, then, were the mutual feelings of the
party assembled at the Rainsfield's table, as
they sat down, with all restraint and formality
dissipated from their circle. Mrs. Rainsfield,
who was bent upon a <i>coup de main</i>, now proposed
to John Ferguson, that he should stop
the night at Strawberry Hill; and she would
make up a little pic-nic, for the following day,
to the falls of the Wombi; which she had
heard the people talk a good deal about, and
had often desired to see. She said she had
contemplated the party for some time, and
wished to have had it organized while William
was at home; but John had kept himself so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
much aloof from them, that she had not had
the opportunity. She appealed to her husband
to head the party, but he excused himself on
the grounds of employment, and proposed that
Tom should act as their guide instead; while
he stated, if they wanted any of the men to
carry their things out in the morning, he
would spare them two. This arrangement
they all seemed delighted with; and it was
finally settled that Mrs. Rainsfield, Eleanor,
Tom, and John Ferguson, should start about
eleven o'clock on the following morning, and
that the ladies should prepare a cold collation,
which was to precede them.</p>

<p>The falls of the Wombi were insignificant,
compared with what we are used to witness
in the romantic scenery of Scotland, or the
lake district of England; though in themselves,
and for the Australian bush, they were
at times anything but contemptible. After
heavy rains, when the river was swollen into
a large body of water, they were certainly
grand. During the early part of the summer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
when the stream was lower, they might be
designated pretty; but towards the close of
the dry season, when the rivers ceased to flow,
and their courses become divided into endless
chains of pools, preserving in their concatenation
an independent existence, the "falls"
were either extremely mean, or entirely
evanescent. For the present, however, we
will refrain from making any further description,
until we visit them with our friends
on the morrow; merely premising that the
summer was about half spent, that it was in
fact about Christmas time, and the water in
the creek rather low.</p>

<p>On the following day, as had been previously
arranged, the party, having been preceded by
the provender carriers, mounted their horses
and moved off from the house under the
guidance of Tom Rainsfield. The shortest
route to the falls lay through the bush, in
a direct line of about seven miles; but the
equestrians preferred following up the course
of the river; as, though longer by some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
three miles, it was pleasanter and more
picturesque. At the same time they had no
desire to hurry themselves; but determined
to spend the greater portion of the day in
the excursion, and therefore rode on at their
leisure, in couples; how arranged, we need
not say.</p>

<p>After nearly two hours riding, upon their
arrival at the desired goal, the scene that
presented itself to their view, was pleasing
and charmingly picturesque. Facing the party,
and extending in either direction for a considerable
distance, was a ridge or range forming
a natural terrace, rising from eighty to
a hundred feet almost perpendicularly. It was
literally covered with bush of various descriptions,
from the dwarfish wattle to the lofty
gum, and iron bark; presenting to each other,
in their various tints of foliage, a relieving
contrast of colour. From the very midst of
this, the fall emerged; and after tumbling
over a few impediments in its way, through
which it seemed vainly endeavouring to force<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
a passage, it made a leap of about sixty feet;
and formed as pretty a little cascade as could
be imagined.</p>

<p>The party stopped at the head of the creek,
where they obtained a good view of the falls;
and were perfectly enraptured with the scene,
which, though in itself was but ordinary, had
an influence, in the circumstances under
which they were assembled, in directing their
minds into a pleased and contented channel.
Besides, there was a novelty in such scenery in
Australia; and humble as the pretensions of
the falls might have been to the picturesque,
in the eyes of an English tourist, John
Ferguson, who had rarely, and Eleanor Rainsfield,
who had never seen anything like it,
could not help admiring the beauty of the
landscape. Our friends soon selected a spot
for their camp; in fact, the spot had already
been chosen by their harbingers, who had
fixed upon a little rising knoll on the bank of
the creek, a short distance below the falls; of
which they commanded an excellent view.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
Here the party dismounted, and leaving the
horses to the care of the men, they discussed
the nature of their further proceedings; while
the ladies arranged their equestrian habiliments,
so as not to incommode them in their
walking. Then putting all things in order
for their luncheon, and requesting the men to
boil some water (on a fire the fellows had
kindled), for the purpose of making that
universal beverage in the bush, without which
no meal would be considered complete; Mrs.
Rainsfield proposed to the gentlemen that
they should take a walk up to the falls, and
see if the ascent of the range was practicable,
and if so, what sort of a prospect there was
from the summit.</p>

<p>The suggestion was instantly acted upon;
and after thoroughly surveying the falls, from
every point of view at its foot, Tom was despatched
to attempt the ascent; while the rest
in the meantime sat down on the grass, to await
his return. This, however, was not until some
time had elapsed; and when he did make his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
appearance, he stated that the range could be
mounted; but he would not advise them to
try it, as the hill abounded with snakes. He
then hurriedly informed them, that he had
come down for a gun, which he had noticed
one of the men had brought with him; and
was going to return to shoot a reptile that
had impeded his progress. Mrs. Rainsfield
desired him to stay, saying she was sure the
snake would not have waited for his return;
but he only laughed and assured her that he
would certainly find it upon his return, and
bring it to her as a trophy. He then dashed
away, and was seen in a few minutes, posting
up the acclivity with the gun in his hand
ready for execution.</p>

<p>"What a stupid fellow that is," remarked
Mrs. Rainsfield, "to be running away from us
to kill a snake, and perhaps incur the risk of
getting bitten by another. While he was here,
and it was not safe for us to go up, he might
as well have remained."</p>

<p>We will not follow the conversation that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
ensued; but merely state that after some
minutes had elapsed, as the party began to
expect the return of Tom disappointed of his
game, a shot was heard, and after a few moments
another; upon which Mrs. Rainsfield
remarked, "I suppose we shall soon see our
snake-hunter now, and see what sport he has
had. If he does not produce some trophy, we
must give him no peace; but here he comes."
At which moment Tom Rainsfield presented
himself, and threw down before his friends
the bodies of two green snakes; which we
may here remark are a kind extremely dangerous,
from the difficulty of detecting them,
owing to their colour so much resembling
that of the foliage of the trees or grass. The
ladies instantly jumped up from their sitting
posture with a scream; but perceiving that
the snakes were no longer dangerous, they
were speedily reassured, and demanded to
hear the adventure which had resulted in
their destruction. This Tom promised to tell
them, after he had submitted his hands to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
slight ablution in the creek; and accordingly
did so as they retraced their steps to the
camp; and we, to enlighten the reader on the
subject, will follow him succinctly in his own
words.</p>

<p>"I managed," said he, "to get up the face
of the range with some difficulty, for it was
awfully steep; but though I succeeded in
reaching the top, I had little or nothing for
my trouble; for beyond an expanse of bush,
there was absolutely no view. It is true I
could just obtain a glimpse of 'the hill,' and
the windings of the river at various bends,
but that was all; and the prospect was certainly
not worth the trouble of reaching the
elevation to obtain. I was soon satisfied with
its contemplation; and turned to come down,
which, if not convenient or safe, was certainly
easy and expeditious; for I had continually
to hold on by one of the overhanging
branches of the smaller trees, and either slide,
jump, or precipitate myself down steeps and
over perpendicular rocks. In making one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
these little exploits, I lost my footing by dislodging
a large stone; which, but for the
grasp I had of the stout bough of a tree, I
should certainly have followed. However, I
saved myself; and watching the stone in
its downward progress, as it went bounding
along, taking others with it in its descent, and
crushing the small bushes in its passage; I
saw, or fancied I saw, a large green snake
suddenly dart out of its way, and up into a
tree. I kept my eye on the tree until I got
down to it; and then minutely inspected
every branch, as well as I could with my
simple vision, but could see nothing. I then
thought I might have been mistaken, but at
the same time, could hardly believe my eyes
had been deceived. The tree was only a
young sapling, and could be bent with ease;
so to satisfy myself, I determined to try if my
friend was a myth, or a genuine snake, which
had really taken up his quarters in the sheltering
boughs above my head. With this
intent I took its stem in my double grasp, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
gave it a shake, the like of which I am certain
it never had since it became a tree; it was
enough to shake the very ghost out of it, and
had the effect of displacing my verdant friend,
who dropt at my very feet. He did not exactly
know what to make of it, though he did
not wait long to consider, for he soon twisted
off, and darted into another tree rather larger
than the first."</p>

<p>"I then looked out for a good-sized-stick, to
touch him up with when he next visited
<i>terra firma</i>; and for the purpose of discovering
his position, and compelling his
immediate capitulation, I besieged the tree
with stones. He was not long in giving me
indication of his <i>locale</i>, for I soon distinguished
him, coiled round a branch almost at
its extreme end; with his head and about a
foot of his body protruding. I continued to
pelt him; and he to dart his head at me,
thrusting out his tongue and hissing fearfully,
as much as to say, 'If I only could, wouldn't I,
hat's all.' I twice or thrice shook him in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
position, but could not dislodge him; for he
had got himself too firmly coiled round the
bough: then I thought of our fellow's gun.
I knew the snake was too frightened to leave
his place for some time; so I discontinued the
discharge of my missiles, took my note of the
tree, came down for the fowling-piece, returned
to the scene of battle; and then
commenced another pelting, to ascertain if
the reptile had retained his post. Sure
enough it was there, for the head soon made
itself visible; but strange to say from quite a
different part of the tree. I imagined from
this, that the beast must have removed in my
absence; but I was mistaken, for I soon
detected my friend in his old place, and
perceived that I had got a pair of beauties to
deal with. I was aware that the snakes
usually go in pairs; but having seen the first
one mount the tree alone, I never dreamt of
his having a mate, which I suppose must
have joined him while I was away. However,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
I soon made short work of the two; for I shot
them one after the other, and they dropt
down as quietly as possible; while I gave
them each a crack on the head, to knock out
any sense that might have remained, and
then laid them, like a dutiful gallant, at your
feet."</p>

<p>"You were certainly very gracious, but we
could have well dispensed with that piece of
gallantry," replied his sister-in-law; "however,
we forgive you: and now for our repast."</p>

<p>The repast was soon spread on a cloth on
the grass; and the party sat down to its
discussion in the highest glee, which was
maintained during the meal's <a name="continuance" id="continuance"></a><ins title="original had continnauce">continuance</ins>.
Theirs was the cup "which cheers, but not
inebriates;" and they indulged in their merriments
and pleasantries, without the aid of
those stimulants which create an excitement
at the expense of health, both corporeal and
mental. After the conclusion of their tiffin,
Mrs. Rainsfield proposed a walk down the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
bank of the creek, to collect a few of the wild
flowers she had noticed when coming up; and
leaving the man in attendance to pack up the
things, and have their horses ready for them
in about half an hour or so, they sauntered
along the stream.</p>

</div>

<p>John and Eleanor, followed by Mrs. Rainsfield
and Tom, commenced their gathering
of the forest's blossoms, and sauntered on
without any seeming interest in their occupation;
for their thoughts were otherwise
centred. Eleanor would walk by the side of
her companion, supporting her part for some
minutes at a stretch, in a spirited and lively
conversation; ever and anon directing her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
lovely eyes to the features of John; while he, in
ecstasies with the warmth of her manner, returned
the glance with redoubled tenderness;
and with the force of his ardent and inspiring
conversation communicated the blush of
pleasure to her cheek.</p>

<p>Thus they walked on for some time
quite absorbed in themselves, until they
found they had got considerably in advance
of their companions; so much so, that they
could not even see them. Upon this discovery,
John suggested that their friends might have
slightly deviated from the track; allured,
perhaps, into the bush by something that
might have attracted their attention, and were
possibly not far off. He therefore proposed
that Eleanor and himself should sit down and
wait until they overtook them; but to this
his companion was unwilling to agree. He
however combatted her opinion that they had
returned, and that it would be better for
herself and him to retrace their steps also, by
saying that Mrs. Rainsfield would never turn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
back without first giving them intimation;
and that by retracing their steps then, they
would possibly miss, and give one another a
good deal of trouble and uneasiness, in a
mutual search. Whether this advice was
agreeable or not to Eleanor, we cannot say,
but she silently complied; and sat down by
his side, as he threw himself on the grass.</p>

<p>John, at this moment, became absorbed with
thoughts that entirely subverted his former
cheerfulness. The circumstances of his situation
presented themselves to his mind's eye in
full force; and suggested, as their solitude
had very opportunely afforded him the means
of declaring to Eleanor the feelings uppermost
in his thoughts, and which he had so long
burned to disclose, that <a name="he" id="he"></a><ins title="original had the">he</ins> should not allow
it to slip. But his heart failed within him, as
he was on the point of giving utterance to his
love; and though it spoke volumes, his tongue
failed to articulate a sound. Thus they sat
for some minutes, when Eleanor broke the
silence by remarking, "What can have become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
of those truants?" and recieving no reply
from her companion, directed an enquiring
gaze to his face.</p>

<p>In that countenance, where she used to
witness animation and spirit, she now only
detected profound abstraction, and a vision
directed fixedly into space. She contemplated
the features for some few moments; and then,
while she laid her hand upon John's shoulder,
addressed him with the enquiry, "May I
participate in the pleasure of your thoughts,
Mr. Ferguson? they must be deeply interesting,
for they seem to have engrossed your
entire attention."</p>

<p>John started at the sound of Eleanor's voice,
and awaking from his reverie, while he siezed
in his fevered grasp the hand of his companion,
replied: "Indeed you may, my dear
Eleanor (pardon my familiarity); your sweet
voice has broken the spell; and if you
experience pleasure from a recital of my
thoughts, I shall indeed be the happiest
mortal on earth. When I say I love you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Eleanor, I convey but a shadow of what I
inwardly feel; it has long been my one
consuming fire; you, and you alone, are the
object of my warmest and tenderest affections.
Your kind and sweet excellence first won my
regard, and I early learnt to cherish your
image as my soul's talisman and idol; but ere
I had an opportunity of breathing in your ear
the nature of the fire that consumed me, my
hopes were blighted. I learnt from your
cousin the existence of an engagement that
has stamped my spirit with despair; and
though I have striven to forget you, save as a
dear friend, and have almost driven myself
frantic in the struggle, yet it is without success.
At a time, when I had almost banished
from my memory the existence of my passion,
some passing object would reflect your
image in the mirror of my mind, and would
render me almost demented with the thought
that your charms were destined to bless some
other one. Oh, say my angel! can that be?
Is it possible your troth is plighted to another?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
Pray, speak; my destiny hangs upon your
answer. Say but that you bid me hope; that
you will not reject me; anything rather than
discard or banish me from your presence,
without the chance of catching one ray of the
sunshine of your smile."</p>

<p>John then paused, and gently removing the
hand that attempted to conceal her face, in a
more subdued tone he continued, "You weep;
I have been wild, I have agitated you. Oh,
hear me, Eleanor! be but mine, and I need
not tell you I will cherish you above all
earthly prizes. I already love you to distraction;
I would thenceforth live but for thee.
You are silent; you do not reciprocate my
feeling. Oh, this torture! Utter my doom,
for I can bear it. I see it is as I feared; you
are engaged to another. Oh! speak, Eleanor,
is it not so?"</p>

<p>"It is, sir," uttered a voice that made both
parties start, and that put an end to John's
declaration. "She is engaged to me, and if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
she will not say it herself, I will for her; and
at the same time I have to intimate to you,
that since I have discovered your pretensions,
I do not intend to permit them to go unpunished,
unless you instantly quit the lady's
side;" and the speaker, Bob Smithers, flourished
his whip in a menacing attitude, as he stalked
up to the couple, who had now risen.</p>

<p>"As to you and your threats," replied John
Ferguson, "I both equally scorn to notice.
Since you have chosen to act the part of eavesdropper,
you have certainly overheard our
conversation; but my question was directed to
Miss Rainsfield, not to you; therefore, I
decline recognising your interference. If Miss
Rainsfield desires me to leave her presence, I
will do so instantly, and&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, Mr. Ferguson," sobbed
Eleanor, "don't leave me with that&mdash;with
Mr. Smithers."</p>

<p>"I would not leave you, but in the care of
your friends," replied John; and then continuing
his remark to Smithers, he said, "and if I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
hear, from her own lips, that she acknowledges
her engagement to you, from the respect
which I entertain for her, I will at once withdraw
my pretensions."</p>

<p>"Ask her," exclaimed Smithers; "let her
answer for herself."</p>

<p>"Is it so, Miss Rainsfield?" asked our dejected
hero; "make no scruple of answering,
for fear of giving <i>me</i> pain, I am perfectly
inured to its trials."</p>

<p>Poor Eleanor essayed to speak, but she
could not; her heart was too full for utterance,
and she covered her face with her hands,
and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Speak, Eleanor," cried Smithers, "and tell
him, whether or not you are engaged to me."</p>

<p>Eleanor took her hands from her face, and
with an effort, which cost her her consciousness,
exclaimed, "I am;" and immediately sank
to the ground insensible. John stooped to
raise her prostrate form, but was rudely
pushed on one side by his opponent; who
exclaimed, with an oath, that "he would knock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
him down if he dared to lay a finger on the
lady."</p>

<p>"At any other time," cried John, "and
under any other circumstances, I would have
resented your insult in a manner that would
have given you cause to remember me; at
present, however, I shall consider you beneath
even my contempt. This young lady was
entrusted to my protection by her own family,
who are not far distant; so touch me again
at your peril;" saying which he advanced, and
lifted the inanimate form of his beloved
Eleanor.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this?" cried Mrs.
Rainsfield, as she burst upon the scene.
"What, Eleanor fainted?" and she flew to the
assistance of her cousin, who under her sympathetic
administration speedily exhibited
signs of returning consciousness. Then having
time to address herself to the parties about
her, Mrs. Rainsfield at once turned to Smithers,
and in a voice, and with a look of scorn, said:
"I perceive you, sir, are the cause of this, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
is in perfect keeping with your usual barbarity.
I request you will instantly remove from our
presence; as I have no desire, that my cousin's
nerves should be again shocked, by either the
recollection of the past, or the recurrence of
future attrocities; both of which are entailed
by your presence."</p>

<p>"For that speech, madam," exclaimed
Smithers, "you may thank yourself you wear
the female garb, or, by heaven! I would give
you good cause to repent it."</p>

<p>"I am well aware of it, sir," replied the lady,
"if your courage permitted, you would attempt
it; and even woman as I am, I doubt
not, you would not hesitate the application of
your whip, were it not for the restraining
influence of these gentlemen present. But go,
sir; we wish no parley."</p>

<p>"The advisableness of that motion, madam,"
said Smithers, "I will reserve to myself the
right to decide. I am the most interested in
the young lady, who seems so much affected;
resulting, I presume, from my having detected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
her in a position with that gentleman
(scowling at John) which not only reflects
impropriety on her, but discredit to you."</p>

<p>"That, sir," almost shrieked the now exasperated
lady, "you have no right to affirm.
We, as her relations, are the best judges of
her conduct, as well as our own; and if Miss
Rainsfield is objectionable to you, I have no
doubt she will at once exonerate you from
your engagement. But I have to request that
you leave us; for the instant Miss Rainsfield
sufficiently recovers to walk, we will remove
from the spot; and you need not flatter
yourself you'll be permitted to follow us."</p>

<p>"You considerably over-estimate your own
attractions, madam," replied Smithers; "and
the merits of your friends, if you imagine
they are sufficiently seductive to induce me
to deviate from my path by following your
steps. But I am neither disposed to forgo
my claim on Miss Rainsfield, nor to permit
the pretensions of any other suitor."</p>

<p>How long this controversy would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
lasted, it is difficult to say, had not Tom
attempted to persuade Smithers to leave
them; and Eleanor, who at the same time
opened her eyes, begged him, in a voice and
look of entreaty to depart, promising to
explain the circumstances to him at some
other time. He then turned away into the
bush, and joined a man who appeared to be
his companion, but whom they had not before
noticed; while the party retraced their steps
to the camp, and were soon on their way
home. The feelings that agitated their
various breasts, we will leave the reader to
conjecture; merely stating that they so
operated, as to cause the journey to be
performed almost in silence. When they
reached Strawberry Hill, Eleanor at once
proceeded to her chamber, and in her privacy
gave vent to the feelings that overpowered
her in a flood of tears; while John, very
much subdued in spirit, almost immediately
took his departure, accompanied by Tom
Rainsfield.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>We may now explain the sudden appearance
of Bob Smithers, when he so unceremoniously
interrupted the <i>tete-a-tete</i> of John and
Eleanor. He had been accompanied by a
man (to whom he was attempting to sell a
run on the Gibson, below Fern Vale) to show
him the country; and in returning, having
taken the route by which he would cross the
Wombi at the upper flat on the Dingo plains
a little below the falls, he accidentally caught
the sound of voices as he approached the
river, and being curious to know from whence
they emanated, he rode with his companion
towards the spot. When he came sufficiently
close to see what we have already described,
he could hardly believe his eyes; for he
instantly recognised John Ferguson, though
the lady who was listening to his appeal, he
could not so readily detect. That it must be
Eleanor Rainsfield he did not doubt, though
how she came in such company, and in such
a place, he could not imagine, and could
hardly reconcile to his belief. He, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
listened, and when he caught her name
uttered by her prostrate suitor, his rage at
the discovery was unbounded. Yet his
inquisitiveness to hear more, and know how
she received the addresses, overcame for the
moment, the first impulse of his malevolence;
and kept him silent until the moment, when
he dismounted from his horse, we have seen
him appear on the scene.</p>

<p>After parting from the Rainsfields, he
altered his determination of going home
direct; and arranging with his companion
to meet him at Brompton on the following
day, he dashed his spurs into his horse's
flanks; and being impelled by the excitement
of a jealous frenzy and malice, he pulled up
at Strawberry Hill a full hour before the
pic-nic party made their appearance; and
instantly sought an interview with Mr. Rainsfield.</p>

<p>Not finding him in the house, Bob Smithers
commenced a search; and soon distinguished
his voice in high altercation with some one,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
as he approached the door of the store, where
he overheard the following dialogue.</p>

<p>"I tell you again, you are an old fool; you
knew perfectly well that I never permit these
villainous black scoundrels to come near my
premises; and yet you encourage this fellow
to the place, and allow him to purloin my
property through your want of attention. I
would not care a snuff, were it not that I
have taken considerable pains to keep them
aloof: and I know very well that if they are
allowed to return, I shall never be safe from
their depredations; and this from your infernal
idiotcy and madness."</p>

<p>"You will pardon me, Mr. Rainsfield,"
replied a voice, which distinguished its owner
as Mr. Billing, "it grieves me to be under the
necessity of contradicting you; but, sir, I really
must be permitted to differ from you, in your
expressed opinion of an aberration of my intellect.
I am proud to state, sir, that I have
been ordained by the Almighty with the full
and unimpaired use of my faculties; I can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
readily, sir, however, make allowance for the
ebullition of your feelings; but must most
distinctly beg to inform you, sir, that you
labour under a misapprehension with regard
to my sanity; for I may say in the language
of the immortal bard,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time."</span>
</div>

<p>"Bosh!" ejaculated the other, "a truce to
your trash; you sicken me with your fastidiousness;
and if you are not mad yourself,
you are likely to drive me so. No one unless
afflicted with sheer insanity, would allow that
black fellow into the store; and then above all
things leave him in it. There isn't the slightest
use in your attempting to excuse yourself,
for you can't improve matters: you are a
perfect nuisance in the place; and I declare
if it were not for your family, I would not be
bothered with your continual absurdities."</p>

<p>"I really conceive myself flattered, sir, by
your good opinion of my valuable services;
but doubt not, if they were as insignificant
as you profess my manner of performing them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
is distasteful to you, you would ere this have
dispensed with them. But, Mr. Rainsfield,
you will excuse my freedom, in defending
myself against your imputations on my
capacity; you must know, sir, that I have
been connected with one of the first houses in
London, the firm of Billing, Barlow, &amp; Co., of
Thames Street; and but for the unfortunate
circumstance, of my having allowed myself to
be allured to this country, by the glowing
accounts of designing men, I should, sir, have
still been in the enjoyment of comfortable
means, if not of opulence. My experience
therefore, sir, has been such as to warrant my
assertion; and I utter it, I assure you, sir,
without egotism, but merely as the result of a
practical mercantile life; that I am sufficiently
conversant with business, to undertake
the management of any establishment; even,
I may add, sir, without disparagement to you,
one of greater magnitude than Strawberry
Hill; and also&mdash;</p>

<p>"For goodness sake, stop that trash; what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
on earth has all that got to do with your permitting
the black to enter the store, which is
supposed to be under your charge, and for the
contents of which you are responsible?"</p>

<p>"I was about to explain that point, sir,
when you interrupted me; but my first consideration
was to establish my good fame,
from the imputation cast upon it by you;
which imputation, I am fain to believe, was
uttered in a moment of hastiness; and which,
after I have explained the circumstances of
the case, you will be happy to retract. However,
sir, permit me to continue. The black,
I have every reason to believe, is in the service
of Mr. Ferguson at Fern Vale; for he
came over this morning, while you were
absent at the bridge, with a message for that
gentleman from his overseer; and knowing
him to be on an excursion with the ladies, and
thinking he would be back about mid-day, I
advised him, sir, to delay his return to the
station, until he had seen his master. Hence,
you see, sir, his presence on the station was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
perfectly justifiable. With regard to his
peccancy I will not attempt, sir, to offer any
palliation beyond the expression of my belief,
that the tobacco was taken without any notion
of the offence he was committing; in proof of
which, I may mention, sir, the absence of any
concealment on his part, when you came to
the store. It was natural, sir, he should follow
me about the place, from my having
advised him to stay until the arrival of his
master; and I, having occasion to go to the
store, he accompanied me there; and being
suddenly called away, sir, I inadvertently
perhaps, left the door open and him inside.
Then, it appears, he appropriated the tobacco
you found in his hand, and had I returned
before you came up, I should have as readily
perceived, and as soon induced him to deliver
it. If I might venture, sir, to express an
opinion, I would say, at most, the offence is a
paltry one, and could well be left unnoticed;
more especially as he is, as I have premised, a
servant of Mr. Ferguson."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>"Do you think that is any reason why the
scoundrel should escape?" exclaimed Rainsfield.
"When Mr. Ferguson knows as much
about them as I do, he will likewise exclude
them from his place. I have been at considerable
pains at keeping them at a distance,
and do not intend to let them be emboldened
by the success of this scoundrel; which would
necessarily be the case were he to escape
scathless. He shall be punished, and that
speedily and effectually."</p>

<p>At this point of the discussion Bob Smithers
joined the disputants, and having been an unseen
listener to these objurgations; and, having
a natural antipathy to the blacks, and a vindictive
desire to annoy his lately discovered
rival, had a corresponding inclination to support
Mr. Rainsfield's determination to punish
the captive.</p>

<p>"Your arrival, Smithers," said the other, as
Bob entered the store, "is very opportune. I
have just discovered a blackguardly black
fellow stealing tobacco, and it appears from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
my storekeeper's account, he is a servant of
Mr. Ferguson. What would you propose we
should do with him?"</p>

<p>"I would say flog him," replied Smithers;
"take him into the bush, so that his voice
cannot be heard at the house, and tie him
up to a tree; give him a taste of the stock-whip,
and send him home to his master, with
a request that if he takes a fancy to the
brutes, he either keeps them on his run, or
teaches them to exhibit better propensities
when they visit his neighbours."</p>

<p>"A capital idea, by Jove! Smithers," exclaimed
Rainsfield; "we will certainly give
him a tickling. I have got a fellow on the
station that would cut a piece clean out of
the hide of a bullock with his stock-whip. I
will get him to manipulate; and I calculate,
our darkie here will not trouble us with his
presence again." As he said this he joined
his companion in a burst of merriment at the
wonder depicted in the countenance of their
almost unconscious victim, who evidently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
anticipated rough usage, though perfectly ignorant
of the nature of the sentence passed
upon him. Rainsfield then called one of the
men, and directed him to get Smith, the
stock-man, to take the black fellow into the
bush for a few hundred yards, and tie him
up to a tree with his back bared, and take
a stock-whip with him, and await the coming
of himself and Mr. Smithers.</p>

<p>"You surely, gentlemen, do not intend
putting your threat into execution," cried
Billing, who was standing amazed at the
coolness of their preparations. "I appeal,
sir, to your sense of honour, to your love of
justice, to your charitableness, to induce you
to desist from the perpetration of so vile an
outrage on humanity. How can you punish,
sirs, with such severity a poor, ignorant black,
whose offence has been so trifling, that no
honourable man would notice it? Besides,
gentlemen, I maintain it is unjust to punish
a poor aboriginal for an action in which he
perceives or knows no wrong. If you persist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
in the fulfilment of this barbarity, and violation
of your charge as Justices of the Peace,
let your own consciences be your accusers."</p>

<p>The result of this harangue was only the
production of an inordinate burst of laughter
from both Rainsfield and Smithers; who, without
any further notice of the philanthropic
storekeeper, than a forcible request from the
latter to visit certain regions, the utterance
of which would be unpleasant to ears polite,
they followed the men to the place of punishment.</p>

<p>We will not accompany them to witness
this scene, the disgusting and unfeeling nature
of which we cannot sufficiently condemn,
but merely state that for some minutes the
air was rent by the shrieks of the victim;
while the two gentlemen and J.P. watched
the process, and then returned arm in arm
to the house in high glee. Upon reaching
the domicile, and discovering that the pic-nic
party had come back, Smithers drew his
companion away, and told him he wished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
to have a few minutes conversation with him
privately; whereupon Rainsfield, first ascertaining
that Eleanor had retired to bed, that
his wife was with her, and that his brother
and Ferguson had gone to Fern Vale, returned
with his companion to the store: in
which they locked themselves. What was the
nature of their conversation we can pretty
correctly conjecture; as also, no doubt, can
our readers. It will, therefore, be unnecessary
for us to trespass on their privacy; to the
full enjoyment of which we will leave them.</p>

</div>

<p>Before William had been long at Acacia
Creek he began to experience the impatience
of his sister in her incessant promptings to
commence his journey; and, notwithstanding
that he knew their house could not be ready
for her reception for some time, he was constrained
to submit to Kate's desire to enter
at once upon her probationary visit. Their
arrangements were soon made, and the young
lady was not the last who was ready for
the start; her mind was not troubled with
a superfluity of apparel, or an infinity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
boxes. We cannot say if she was peculiar to
her sex in this respect, but certain it is she
did not hesitate to make the journey without
the legion of packages which are usually the
concomitants of travelling ladies. All her
paraphernalia was comfortably settled on the
back of a pack-horse, while her general effects
were left to be forwarded to her brother's
station as opportunity offered.</p>

<p>That Kate Ferguson left her father's house
without regret we do not believe; but her
mind was so taken up with the thoughts of
her domestic importance, and she was so
absorbed with the arrangements in perspective,
that she entirely forgot the fact that
she was leaving, perhaps for ever, her parent's
roof; and was about to commence a life subjected
to dangers and inconveniences, which
she, even native born though she was, was
totally unacquainted with. With her parents,
however, it was far different; for they had
been fully informed by John what sort of a
place it was their daughter was going to.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Her father, to say nothing of the regret which
he felt in parting with his child, experienced
some remorse in consigning her to the discomfort
of a wild and unsettled country. At
the same time he was convinced she would be
under good protection, and reconciled himself
to the separation by the thought that probably
the responsibility of managing the domestic
establishment of her brothers would,
in a great measure, prepare her for a more
permanent station in life; and, in fact, rub
off the lingering signs of childhood, and perfect
her in a womanly capacity.</p>

<p>The feelings which agitated the breast of
her mother, when she parted with her darling
daughter, we cannot pretend to describe.
We know that maternals usually give indications
of unbounded grief at parting from
their tender offspring, even upon the consummation
of their earthly happiness. It
may possibly arise from grief at the segregation
of one not only made dear by the
ties of parental and filial affection, but from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
the mutual companionship, reliance, and confidence
that exist between mother and daughter;
possibly it may be for the trials and
dangers that beset the young creatures' paths
in the commencement of their independent
career; or, there may be an alloy of selfishness
in the feeling. But certain it is, it is
one of the mysteries of the female character;
which, though to us inexplicable, we revere;
and, consequently, we sympathize with, and
respect the ebullition of Mrs. Ferguson's grief,
as she wept over her charming daughter, when
the young and inexperienced girl was about
leaving her protection. Many were her parental
admonitions to Kate for her guidance
and good, and numerous her injunctions to
William for her care and preservation. Never
was there a kinder-hearted affectionate parent
than this, and never were brother and
sister more fondly attached. The mother
knowing this, and confident that her son
William would, if necessary, offer himself a
self-immolated victim, sooner than any evil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
should happen to his charge, felt little apprehension
for her daughter's safety.</p>

<p>The travelling party, consisting of Kate,
her brother, and Mr. Wigton, were shortly on
the road, and journeyed till night without
the occurrence of any event worth recording;
until, as darkness closed o'er the landscape,
they entered the town of Warwick, and put
up at the "Bullock's Head." Here William
renewed the acquaintance of his old friend
the Warwick Ganymede, "Hopping Dick;" and
after recommending to the especial attention
of Mr. Wigton and his sister the artistic display
on the coffee-room walls, the rural combination
of beauty and innocence on the
mantelpiece, with their rotund neighbour, the
guardian of the "spills," he gave instructions
to the landlord's representative about their
accommodation, and proceeded to the stable
to satisfy himself that his horses were being
well looked after; knowing that, unless he did
so, the attention and provender they would
receive would be scanty in the extreme.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>On the present occasion, fortunately for our
friends, the bovine cranium was empty, and
William was in high spirits. He had had
serious misgivings at the outset of his journey
in taking his sister to such a place, from the
scene he had on his previous visit seen enacted
in it. But the domiciliary selection
having a contingency attached to it similar
to that which stultified the choice of that
immortal, though, we fear, mythical individual,
yclept Hobson, he had no alternative
but to run the risk of annoyance in this
favourite hostel. William, therefore, was
happy at the thought that there would be no
fear of molestation; and, Warwick being the
only stage where they would have to quarter
at an inn, he felt no apprehension for his
sister's comfort during their further progress.</p>

<p>Hopping Dick speedily made his appearance
to arrange the table for their repast,
while William amused himself by eliciting
information from him of a various nature,
by questions put to the fellow as he con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>tinued
to hover between the coffee-room and
the pantry.</p>

<p>"Have you had any exploits lately, Dick,"
said he, "similar to that which I witnessed
on the first night I stopped here? You remember
when I mean," continued William, as
he remarked the man's abstraction, as if in
thought to what or which exploit he had
referred; "I mean when you had the table
smashed."</p>

<p>"By the gent as tried to take his horse
over it?" enquired the salient-gaited waiter.</p>

<p>"Exactly," replied his interlocutor.</p>

<p>"No, sir; we ain't had no more just like
that 'un lately, not sich roarers. I s'pose ye
know, sir, that 'ere gent, Mr. Smith, what the
'orse belonged to, is dead?"</p>

<p>"No," replied William, "I do not. Pray,
how might that have happened?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, sir, he stopped here for
about a week, for he was uncommon fond of
a spree, and he never reached home after that.
His 'orse comed on to the station one day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
without him, and with the saddle twisted
right round, and hanging under his belly.
So ye see, sir, his people fancied he had got a
'buster' somehow, and went a-search of him,
but couldn't find him nohow. They comed
in here then, and found out what way he
took; and, with some black fellows, they, after
a while, found his track, and run it down till
they found him as quiet as you please on
the broad of his back, with his head cracked.
He was a bit fresh when he left here, so they
thought he might a' been going home, some'ut
mad like, and got a 'spill,' which cook'd him.
Howsomdever, he spent his money like a real
gent, and I'm precious sorry he's dead; for he
was uncom'n good to me, and a good 'un for
custom to the master; the likes of him ain't
seen every day."</p>

<p>Even grieved as William was to hear of
the melancholy and untimely end of such a
man; cut off in the prime of life while in the
mad pursuit of a delirious career, he could not
help indulging in a smile at the strange so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>phistry
of his companion, who imagined that a
lavish waste of substance was the constituted
act of a gentleman; and at the selfishness of
the fellow who regretted the death of the man
only in so far as it affected the pocket of
himself and his employer. But he reflected
it was the way of the world; clothe the feeling
how he would; and he felt no doubt that
perhaps with the solitary exception of a doating
parent who might mourn his death in a
far distant land, the man would pass from
this earth without the regret of a mortal; and
without leaving the remembrance of a virtue,
or good action, to perpetuate his memory.</p>

<p>"Then, I suppose, Dick," continued William,
"you have been quieter lately, since Mr.
Smith was killed."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, we've been somewhat quieter of
late," replied the man; "but we expect to
get a turn again soon. The shearers round
the stations will be done their work shortly,
and they'll be in with their cheques. Some
on 'em a' done already; for we had a party in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
last week of about eight, and they only went
away yesterday."</p>

<p>"And I suppose spent their money too,
like real gentleman, eh, Dick?" said William
laughing.</p>

<p>"Why, sir," replied the man, "some on 'em
did knock down their pile, and when they
left here they was regularly cleared out."</p>

<p>"And how much had they spent individually
do you think?" enquired the young
squatter.</p>

<p>"That I couldn't exactly say," replied the
other; "some on 'em knocked down twenty
pounds or so, but some on 'em stuck to their
tin, as they was a going down the country."</p>

<p>"Probably it was the intention of the
whole party to go down the country until
they came here; don't you think so, Dick?"
asked William.</p>

<p>"Praps it was, sir, but some on 'em had to
go back agin to work," naively replied the
Ganymede.</p>

<p>"But how on earth could one man spend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
twenty pounds in a week, by merely drinking?"
enquired William.</p>

<p>"Easy enough, sir," replied the fellow;
"some of those chaps, when they get the
drink in 'em, will 'shout' for the whole town;
and you know it ain't our buisness to stop
'em; we only sells the grog, and they buy it."</p>

<p>William had often heard of such practices
as these where poor deluded wretches, after
toiling hard to obtain their wages, had
no sooner received a cheque or draft from
their employers in settlement of what was
due them, than they would rush to the first
public-house; and, placing their cheque in the
hands of the publican, would commence a
course of mad dissipation; merely requesting
to be informed when the money was expended.
This had been told him, and also
that the victims, after being kept in a state
of delirium for a week or so, had it intimated
to them that their funds were exhausted;
that they had been "shouting" to all the
town, or in other words, that they had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
providing drink to all who chose to partake;
in which belief they were compelled to be
satisfied and take their departure. Not only
twenty, but often fifty, and even a hundred
pounds, he had heard had been embezzled
from men under such circumstances; and
though he had never before seen instances to
warrant his belief in such statements, he was
now convinced of the existence of the
iniquitous system; for this satellite of the
demon had admitted the fact, and spoken of
it as the mere course of business. William
felt disgusted with the cool infamy of the
fellow, and at the magnitude and effrontery
of the publican's dishonesty. It was melancholy
for him, as for any sentient creature, to
contemplate the blind infatuation with which
bushmen generally squander their money; or,
more properly speaking, allow themselves to
be robbed of it. Yet they are willing victims,
while there is neither protection for them, nor
punishment for the men whose criminality is
so glaring.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>Such were William's thoughts as Mr. Wigton
entered the room. To the clergyman
our young friend communicated the conversation
he had had with the waiter; and for
sometime, until they were joined by Kate,
the two gentlemen discussed the nature of that
evil, which they both lamented; without being
able to clearly define a means for the extrication
of the unfortunate class.</p>

<p>"I can very well see," remarked Mr. Wigton,
"the impulse under which these persons
act. They are placed suddenly in possession
of money; in the control of which they have
previously had no experience; and, carried
away by the advice, and influenced by the
example of associates, they first learn that
extravagance which ends in an improvidence
that leaves them continually without a shilling.
If they have any idea of being saving
they are at a loss how to invest their savings;
for no means present themselves; their opportunities
of purchasing lands, on which to
settle, are so rare that they hardly believe its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
possession within the range of possibility;
and they consequently submit to the decrees
of evil. Being without the benefit of good
advice, and the application of sound precepts,
they see no other course open to them, but
a reckless expenditure of their hard-earned
gains."</p>

<p>"But do you not think, my dear sir," said
William, "that some means could be devised
to cultivate a feeling of prudence in these
men? can they not be induced to abandon
their suicidal extravagance?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," replied his companion,
"means could be adopted; but unless the
matter is taken up by the employers, or our
legislators, I fear nothing will ever be done
to ransom the men. Besides, I believe the
squatters consider it to their interest to
nourish the practice, as it keeps the men
more dependent upon them. If the employers
could be persuaded to interest themselves on
the subject I would hope for better things.
Many plans would be useful, such as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
establishment of savings banks for instance;
but the principal, the desideratum in fact, is
the facile procuration of cheap land. A man
should be able at any moment to go to the
survey office, or some local agent, and select
a piece of land that would be suitable for
agriculture; and be at liberty at once to take
possession, and commence cultivation. Such
would be the best means of ensuring thriftiness;
and, until we obtain some such system,
I fear we may labour in vain to induce economy.
Not that the difficulty is insuperable.
I have fortunately been the humble instrument
of arresting many poor men from such
headlong folly; by first inducing them to
feel a disgust for the filthy and degrading
dissipation which they indulge in. But I
have never been able to give any advice in
the disposal of their means, from the fact that
I know of no channels into which to divert
them."</p>

<p>At this point, the discussion ceased by the
entrance of Kate, and the trio sat down to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
their meal, undisturbed by the presence of
strangers; and as the topics of the conversation
which ensued, though exceedingly animated
and interesting to the parties engaged
in it, are not at all pertinent to our story,
nor would be interesting to our readers, we
may be permitted to draw a veil over the
scene, until the conclusion of the repast.</p>

<p>William had a strong desire to question
the strange character who waited at table;
firmly believing him to be an infamous
scoundrel, though gifted in a vicious lore, out
of which our young friend had a wish to
extract information. For this purpose, soon
after the clearance of the cloth, he rose from
the table, and leaving his sister in the society
of Mr. Wigton, followed Dick into his own
regions. Having lit his pipe at the kitchen
fire, he took his seat to wait until Hopping
Dick was sufficiently disengaged to admit of
his answering his interrogations. The fellow
himself seemed to like being drawn into
conversation, and William had therefore little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
difficulty in inducing him to be communicative;
for by the aid of a stiff glass of grog,
or as we would say, in the parlance of the
country, "a ball," Dick's heart was softened;
and he smiled his satisfaction in a sardonic
grin, which had anything but amiability in
its expression. Having finished the satisfying
of his own inward man; and commenced the
indulgence of adding his contribution to the
general nicotian pregnated atmosphere, while
proceeding about his vocation, he replied to
William's various questions with a wonderful
alacrity and volubility, strangely contrasting
with the taciturn moroseness which had appeared
to be his usual manner. Warmed
with the genial influence of the spirituous
unction, his bosom, if he was possessed of such
a divison of anatomy, was opened to his young
companion; and he not only gave him a
perfect outline of his own history, but a
synopsis of that of his master, together with
other particulars, various and heterogeneous.
As the reader may desire some little ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>quaintance
of Dick's career, we will detail it;
and, to save the infliction of that individual's
verbosity and jargon, render his narrative into
a more comprehensive vernacular; prefacing
it with the remark, that the adventures of the
narrator must not be considered as a rule, or
a characteristic of the inhabitants of the
colony. Hopping Dick was an exception; he
was in fact one of the last specimens of a
class, now happily nearly extinct.</p>

<p>Hopping Dick was a "lag" and a "lifer;"
or to be more explicit, he was one of those
gentlemen who "leave their country for their
country's good," and whose period of expatriation
is for the term of their natural lives.
What was the nature of the offence that caused
his transportation we are unable to say positively,
though we can form a pretty shrewd
opinion. By his own account, all the justiciary
of England conspired in unholy league
to effect his ruin, and did not rest until they
had accomplished their dread designs. Though
we have no doubt he was very hardly dealt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
with in the deprivation of his liberty, we
strongly suspect our friend had a predilection
for visiting the domiciles of his fellow citizens,
slightly in opposition to their wishes; and
dropping in at most unseasonable hours, by
means of some instrumental application of his
own, detrimental to the locks and fastenings
of such dwellings. In addition to this, he
sometimes had a playful manner of titulating
the craniums of his friends, so visited, with a
toyish sort of article he was induced to carry
on his person for his own vital preservation.</p>

<p>It was on one occasion when he was going
to see "his gal" (he said), who lived in a fashionable
locality of London, he had been kept
pretty late with some of his friends (or "pals,"
as he vulgarly designated them), and when
he got to her house he discovered she had
forgotten to leave the door open for him; but
being pretty well acquainted with that accomplishment
of the "force," area scaling, and
being supplied with his own latch-key, he did
not think much of her neglect. But, strange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
to say, and considerably to the astonishment
of Dick, the head of the family had a strong
objection to that individual's visiting his
ladye love; and absolutely mistaking him for
a common burglar, seized him, with <i>malice
prepens&eacute;</i>, to hand him over to "the perlice."
Dick, under these circumstances, had no alternative
but to knock his assailant down;
but the screaming that was made in the
house caused the appearance of those metropolitan
enemies of freedom, the "peelers,"
who marched him off in custody. He was
tried by a jury of his countrymen, who were
so far biassed by his arch-enemy the judge,
as to convict him of burglary, which resulted
in the provision of a free passage for him
to the rising settlement of Botany Bay. Upon
his arrival at his destination our unfortunate
friend was drafted to the penal settlement on
the Hunter river; where he remained some
time, until he was made over as an "assigned
servant" to a settler in that district.</p>

<p>The master to whom Dick was assigned,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
like many more in the country, was one
who had received a large grant of land from
the government, and was clearing and putting
under cultivation a considerable portion
by the labour of the convicts; who were at
that time assigned by the government to any
settler who would undertake to clothe and
feed them. Under such a system, as might
be imagined, the convict's apparel was of the
meanest texture, and their food of the coarsest
description; and while they were made
to work under the terror of the lash, and the
eye of an overseer (often excelling in barbarous
cruelty the vaunted atrocities of the
American slave-drivers), flagellation was the
ordeal they were almost constantly permeating.</p>

<p>Dick had not been long with his new
master before he discovered the nature of
the tyranny to which he would be subjected.
His first taste of his penal life was on an
occasion when he complained to the overseer
of the nature of the tools with which he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
working. Such flagrant presumption could
not, of course, be tolerated; the overseer reported
him to the master; the master laid a
charge of insubordination against him before
the magistrate, and he was forthwith visited
with the due punishment of the law, in the
shape of fifty lashes; after which, with his
body bleeding and lacerated, he was sent back
to his work.</p>

<p>It is impossible to picture, with sufficient
force, the horrors and atrocities of the penal
times. We do not consider ourselves adequate
to the task of exposure and condemnation;
but, though we do not approve a life
of ease and comfort accorded to condemned
felons, we unhesitatingly affirm, that in most,
if not all cases, the cruel treatment which the
convicts underwent, instead of having a penitential
influence, only served to harden them
in their iniquities; and while they frequently
became perfectly callous to the infliction of
punishment, they were debased to the incarnation
of fiends, merely wanting in the o<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>pportunity
to perpetrate the most atrocious
villanies in retribution.</p>

<p>If Dick had ever entertained any disposition
of a reformatory nature, it was entirely
dissipated by his early experience. He only
waited the auspicious moment when he could
follow the steps of hundreds of others who
had been similarly situated, but had escaped
to become "bush-rangers," and the terror of
the country. An opportunity was not long
in presenting itself; and he, with a party of
six as desperate ruffians as himself, contrived
to elude the vigilance of their masters, and
get into the bush. Their sufferings and privations
were extreme; little short of the hateful
servitude from which they fled; but they preferred
anything, even death itself, rather than
return to a repetition of their bondage. Their
escape, however, was soon detected, and they
were pursued by a small company of military;
who succeeded in surprising them in the
mountains, and upon their attempting to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>escape, fired upon them. In this recontre
two of the convicts were killed, and three
others were wounded. Of these, Dick was
one, for he received a shot in the knee from
which he never thoroughly recovered; while
the muscular contraction that ensued, from
the want of surgical treatment, caused the
deformity which gave rise to his appellation.</p>

<p>When he was retaken and brought back
to the settlement, he was thrown back again
upon the government, and put into the
"chain-gang," where he worked in irons with
the other incorrigibles. From this, after a
while, he was transferred to a quarry party,
and again made over to a settler as an assigned
servant. His treatment from this
master was even more tyrannical than he had
experienced before; for the most imaginary
offence, and frequently for no offence at all,
but just at the caprice of the master, he was
treated to various applications of the lash, and
restricted allowances of his miserable rations.
His slavery was the most abject, his misery
the most consummate, and his degradation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
the most venal and depraved: he was the
image of the man without the mental spark;
the human being in semblance, but the brute
in reality.</p>

<p>The character of Dick's employer was well
known; and hardened as all were by the
repetition of scenes that would have made the
heart of a novice sicken, most, even of the
officials, looked upon him as too harsh and
cruel, though none attempted to check his
insatiable inhumanity. A circumstance, however,
transpired, which speedily brought this
state of things to a crisis. Dick had only
returned one day from the "triangle," with
his body lacerated by the punishment he had
been undergoing, when he was ordered by his
master to instantly resume his labour, while
he taunted him and laughed at his emaciated
appearance. The heat of the sun was oppressive,
and Dick, though he had borne unflinchingly
the infliction of the lash, was sick at
heart, and debilitated by the loss of blood.
All his evil passions were aroused within him;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
and it was only with an unwilling hand and
suppressed oath of threatened vengeance that
he resumed his work; while his tormentor
continued to goad him with a recollection of
his past and present misery, and a prospect
of fresh torture. The unfeeling wretch continued
his banter until human nature could
bear it no longer, and with the spade which
he held in his hand, Dick clove the skull of
his inordinate persecutor. He never attempted
to escape from the fate which he knew
awaited him; but permitted himself to be led
quietly to that confinement which he was
aware would only terminate with the close of
his life. He remained in durance for some
months or so, during which his master hovered
between life and death; who, when he was
sufficiently recovered to be enabled to move
about, was gratified by having the unfortunate
criminal brought to justice.</p>

<p>In those days the laws against the convicts
were very summary; short work was made of
those with whom the rulers experienced much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
trouble; and in a case like this, where a
prisoner attempted the life of a free settler,
his doom was fixed before he was placed at
the bar; nothing but his life could expiate
for such a crime. Dick well knew this, and
also that if there were any mitigating circumstances,
his master would spare no trouble in
securing his execution; he was not therefore
at all surprised that he was sentenced to the
extreme rigour of the law. However, death
appeared to the miserable culprit only a
release from his bodily suffering; and he
hailed its consummation with more delight
than he had experienced in any of his earthly
pursuits; but his sufferings were not yet at
an end. His execution was fixed; notwithstanding
that some slight effort was made to
save him by some persons more humane than
their compeers, and who knew the character
of the victim's persecutor; and he was led
away to the final scene of his drama. Before
the adjustment of the hempen order he was
enlivened by the brutal taunts and lampoons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
of his master; who, forgetful of his own
narrow escape from the grave, jested, with an
unparalleled coarseness, on the fate awaiting
the condemned wretch before him.</p>

<p>The signal was given; the bolt was withdrawn;
and Dick, with the hoarse laugh of
his master ringing in his ears, was launched
into the air, if not into eternity. But by
some gross mismanagement the culprit's feet
came in contact with the ground; while his
ears continued to be assailed with the blaspheming
raillery of the man, who was equally
deserving of such a fate. In this position the
unfortunate wretch remained, until a hole
was dug to make his suspension complete;
and he was again launched forth; though
with no better success. The authorities were
by this time felt to be in a fix; but the victim
was not to escape, at least, so said the master;
who with an oath, volunteered to finish the
work himself. Carrying his offer into execution,
he mounted the rope that suspended
the criminal, and added his weight by standing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
on the man's shoulders, to effect a dislocation,
or strangulation. But he was again frustrated;
for the rope, which had done service on many
similar occasions, gave way under the additional
weight; and both were precipitated
into the pit, amidst the oaths and imprecations
of the one, and the groans and lamentations
of the other.</p>

<p>The body of the half strangled man was
then removed; while fresh exertions were made
to obtain his reprieve; this time with a better
result; and, notwithstanding the strenuous
opposition of the master, Dick's life was spared;
though it was only to undergo the horrors of
a stricter servitude. This he bore for some
three years; and if by that time, he was not
reformed, he was certainly subdued; while his
apparent docility, being construed into reformation,
had the effect of causing a relaxation
of the rigid discipline under which he
had been placed. He was relieved from the
irons in which he worked, and was permitted
the use of his limbs with more freedom;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
while the use <a name="gobbledegook" id="gobbledegook"></a><ins title="included as appears in original publication">nht psoe hwi cfirt h tth em</ins>
(after he was transferred to the new settlement
of Moreton Bay), was to escape into the bush.
For years nothing further was heard of him;
and, by those who troubled themselves to
bestow a thought upon him, he was supposed
to have perished. But, after the abandonment
of the settlement as a penal depot, when it
was thrown open to the public, a report was
brought in that, in a distant part of the
country, a white man was living with the
blacks in perfect nudity; and, from his long
exposure to the sun, almost of a colour with
his companions. He was said to be robust
looking, but with a malformation by which
one of his legs was longer than the other.
The description answered to the escaped convict,
Dick; and, the circumstances having
been communicated to the government, a
party was sent in quest of him. After some
trouble he was discovered, and brought into
the settlement; but the results of his past
life with the blacks were, that he had entirely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
forgotten his mother tongue, and had acquired
new ways and sympathies that long deterred
him from assimilating to those of the whites.
Considering his many and peculiar vicissitudes,
a remission of the penalty to which he was
liable was obtained from the Crown; and a
perpetual ticket-of-leave was granted him,
provided that he remained in the district of
Moreton Bay.</p>

<p>Such then was the career of this character
related by himself to William, as the latter
sat listening to him; and though his sufferings
had been fearful, and his escapes miraculous,
the catalogue of his trials was only a
counterpart of hundreds or thousands of his
fellows who had either died under their
servitude, or become scourges to the country.
Numerous are the instances of the atrocious
barbarities of a system, which for iniquity
had no parallel; but it is not our object to
enlarge on the dismal subject; and, as we may
have occasion to revert to it again, for the
present we will dismiss it from our thoughts.</p>

<p>The party at the "Bullock's Head" retired
early to rest in order to proceed on their
journey at a corresponding hour on the following
morning. They slept and rose, breakfasted
and resumed their travel; and the same
afternoon arrived at Barra Warra, where they
were welcomed by their kind-hearted friends,
the Dawsons. It is needless for us here to
detail the circumstances of the visit; suffice
it to say, that the lady of the house and Kate
Ferguson at once established their friendship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
on a firm basis; and the gentlemen passed
their time pleasantly, and in a manner congenial
to their respective tastes. The only
event during the period of their sojourn, which
we deem necessary to narrate, is that of preaching
in the bush.</p>

<p>A day or two after their arrival&mdash;on a Sunday
morning&mdash;Mr. Dawson placed his large
wool-shed, which at the time was nearly
empty, at the disposal of Mr. Wigton, for the
purpose of there holding Divine service; and
he gave intimation on the station that such
would take place. Though Mr. Dawson was
a conscientious adherent of the Anglican
church, he was not one of those who, in the
absence of a place of worship where the adoration
is conducted not strictly in accordance
with the prescribed formul&aelig; of his church,
would abstain from attendance on any other
denominational service. He was devoid of such
bigotry; and considered it a duty, when an
opportunity of public worship presented itself
(even though the minister officiating was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
deemed perfectly orthodox by the tenets of
the Episcopalian creed), to avail himself of it.
Where means of ministration were rare, he
considered sectarian distinctions prejudicial
to the cause of the gospel, and deemed the
only essential to be an earnest truthfulness
and piety on the part of the clergyman. He
always encouraged the ordinances of religion
on his station, and the inculcation of moral
principles among his men.</p>

<p>The Sabbath was one of those lovely days
so peculiar to the sunny regions of favoured
Australia. The sky was without a cloud to
vary its unbroken and immaculate azure, and
the sun shone with a voluptuous lustre, which
rendered the atmosphere warm, though not
oppressive, and the face of the country smiling
and cheerful. The people around the
place&mdash;men, women, and children, clean and
neatly clad&mdash;assembled in an orderly manner;
while the sombre stillness of the bush tended
to impress the beholders with an earnestness,
a feeling of devotion, and a confirmed belief,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
that, verily, "the Spirit of the Lord moved
upon the face of the earth." There are, we
venture to say, few more inspiring scenes
than the performance of Divine service, or "a
preaching," in the wilds of the woods; and
we believe the spiritual influence was felt that
day by not a few of the number who listened
to the exposition of the Word, which was
delivered from the lips of the preacher with
a truth and pathos characteristic of a sincere
and devout mind. The same orderly and
sober manner marked the dispersion of the
people, as did their gathering; and if no
spiritual good arose from it (though we sincerely
trust and believe there did), in a
moral point of view the people reaped a reward;
and by the same means, indirectly, the
squatter was benefited.</p>

<p>These preachings contrast pleasingly with
the general thoughtless and frivolous manner
of some of the congregations in our large
towns, and it is only to be regretted that
they are not of more frequent occurrence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
Nothing would more greatly tend to advance
the morals of those people of Australia who
too frequently live in a state of vitiated depravity
and mental degradation, and who are
perfectly destitute of religion, and ignorant
and neglectful of its observances.</p>

<p>When William and his party had remained
at Barra Warra for about a week he thought
it time to push forward to his home; and,
after some little persuasion with Mrs. Dawson,
induced her to part with his sister, and the
young lady to consent to go. They took
their leave amidst a general expression of
cordiality, and an entreaty from their kind
friends to find their way back again as soon
as possible. They then proceeded on their
way, Kate more than ever delighted with
her prospect. In the spontaneous ebullition
of her youthful and innocent feelings, and
charmed beyond measure at the kind reception
she had met with from the amiable
people she had just left, she was in the highest
spirits, and gave frequent vent to her joy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
Her merry peals of laughter rang through
the woods with an echo that sounded as if
all the trees had taken up the chorus, and
supported her in bursts of silvery-toned
cachinnations. She talked and chatted away
the time, asking questions of her brother respecting
the Smitherses and the Rainsfields, and
requesting him to draw comparisons between
the two families and that which they had
lately left. This task William professed himself
unable to accomplish, and unwilling to
attempt; remarking that "comparisons were
odious," and that his sister would be able to
judge for herself if she would exercise a little
patience.</p>

<p>The road was quickly travelled over; and
our friends comfortably completed that day's
stage, and found themselves at Brompton
before dark. They were welcomed by Mr.
and Mrs. Smithers in as friendly a manner
as William had anticipated; but upon Kate
and Mr. Wigton being introduced as strangers
to Bob, he muttered some unintelligible sen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>tence,
turned on his heel, and left the room.
Such extraordinary conduct rather surprised
the Fergusons, especially William; who, when
last he had seen him, parted from him in perfect
good feeling. The proprietor of the station
and his wife were not only astonished,
but exceedingly chagrined to think that their
visitors should have received so gross an insult
from a member of their family. Without
entering into any vituperations on Bob's conduct,
they apologised to their friends for his
inexplicable behaviour, stating their inability
to assign any reason for it beyond his extraordinary
temper, and expressing many regrets
for its occurrence.</p>

<p>The Fergusons professed to think nothing
of it, and begged their friends to take no
heed of the circumstance, as it gave them,
personally, no concern; being convinced that
it could not have been the intention of Mr.
Smithers' brother to have meditated any insult.
Notwithstanding all their assurances
that they in no way felt annoyed, they could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
not remove from the minds of their hosts the
impression that they had received an unwarrantable
insult; and the culprit not "entering
an appearance" again, and no explanation
being forthcoming, the evening passed very
heavily, and a general relief was experienced by
the party when they separated for the night.</p>

<p>On the following morning the Fergusons
and Mr. Wigton resumed their journey, and
the spirit of their travelling contrasted greatly
with that of the previous day. They had
parted from the Smitherses on very good
terms; but Bob had continued to absent himself,
and there was a gloom thrown over the
parting in consequence.</p>

<p>"What a horrid bear that man is," exclaimed
Kate, as she rode between the other
two equestrians. "What could have induced
him to be so rude? Have you any idea,
Will?"</p>

<p>William certainly had an idea, and it
grieved him much to contemplate it, for he
thought he read in the occurrence a rupture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
between his brother and Bob Smithers. But
he was deep in thought when his sister addressed
him, and not until she had repeated
her question did he make any reply; and that
reply, if not strictly the truth, was, he thought,
the best he could make, rather than by uttering
his convictions, to excite the fears of his
sister for her brother John.</p>

<p>"No, my Kate, I do not," replied William,
"but what does it signify? We have no
occasion to trouble ourselves about the circumstance.
Bob Smithers was exceedingly
ungentlemanly in his behaviour; but I believe
he is proverbial for that sort of conduct,
so I think we need not give the matter any
further thought. Do you, Mr. Wigton?"</p>

<p>"You are quite right, William," replied the
minister, "the folly or frivolity of the man,
for at most it is only such, should not be
allowed to give us any uneasiness. If it was
intended to convey any insult, we can best
show our appreciation of it by allowing it
at once to sink into oblivion; but I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
no doubt it may be attributable to his extraordinary
manner, which, you say, is customary."</p>

<p>"Well," said Kate, "I'll tell Miss Rainsfield
of the manner in which he treated us; it is
only right that she should know what a ruffian
he is."</p>

<p>"Now, my thoughtless little sister, you
must do no such thing," said her brother;
"rather studiously avoid mentioning anything
at Strawberry Hill disparaging of Bob Smithers.
Miss Rainsfield must be better acquainted
with the gentleman's character and manner
than either you or I; and the relation of any
such affront as we have received might cause
her considerable and unnecessary pain."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, William," cried the girl. "Miss
Rainsfield ought to know how he acts to
strangers, because, I am sure, he'll always
behave himself before her; and I am convinced
if she only knew what a bear he is,
she would not have anything to say to him."</p>

<p>"Kate," remarked Mr. Wigton, "William is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
quite right; it would be better to say nothing
about the affair, if, as I imagine from
your conversation, this young lady entertains
any regard for Mr. Smithers. She must be
better acquainted with his feelings than we;
consequently, we should avoid the possibility
of creating any contentions between the families;
while, after all, there might have been
nothing in his manner deserving animadversion."</p>

<p>"I think I can see the drift of my fair
sister's plan," said William to Mr. Wigton;
"she has taken a fancy to Bob Smithers
herself, and she thinks by telling this dreadful
tragedy to Miss Rainsfield, that young
lady will be induced to discard him, and
leave the coast open to our Kate."</p>

<p>"You are a most impertinent fellow," exclaimed
Kate, as she attempted to lay her
whip across the shoulders of her brother. "I
detest the man; and if he were to make himself
as pleasant and agreeable as it is possible
for any man to be, I could not endure him."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>"Never mind, my pretty Flora," said her
brother, "we will not submit you to the infliction;
but promise to say nothing to the
Rainsfields of the affair at Brompton."</p>

<p>"If you particularly wish it," replied Kate,
"I will hold my tongue; but I cannot imagine
for why. But tell me," said she, as her usual
smile returned to its wonted place, "how long
shall we be before we arrive at Strawberry
Hill?"</p>

<p>"Not until late," said William, "unless we
mend our pace, so we had better push on;"
with which remark he put spurs to his horse,
and rode at a brisk rate followed hard by his
companions.</p>

<p>Well on in the afternoon they arrived at
Strawberry Hill; and the first inmate of the
house who presented himself was Tom Rainsfield,
who grasped the hand of William, and
was introduced by him to Kate and Mr.
Wigton. The former he expressed much delight
in seeing, and stated he had been looking
out anxiously for her arrival, and would at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
once constitute himself her protector and most
obedient servant. With such little blandishments
he led the arrivals into the house; and
presented with due solemnity the treasure,
that he said had been consigned to his keeping,
to his sister-in-law and his cousin. The ladies
at once received Kate with that affectionate
welcome inherent in women; and, relieving
Tom of his self-imposed responsibility, disappeared
with her to one of those secret conferences,
the mysteries of which we masculine
mortals are destined always to remain in profound
ignorance.</p>

<p>The gentlemen then issued through the
French light, and passed from the room to the
verandah that encompassed the house. Tom
brought out chairs, and desired his visitors to
be seated for a few minutes, until the ladies
returned, while he went in search of his
brother to acquaint him of their arrival.</p>

<p>In a short time Mrs. Rainsfield and her
companions made their appearance all radiant
with smiles, and their faces beaming with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
expressions of good feeling; shortly after
which Tom joined them with Mr. Rainsfield,
who received the travellers with a politeness
that struck William as having some degree
of formality in it. However, a repast was
speedily prepared and set upon the table, to
which all sat down; when everything was
cordiality; and after spending a very pleasant
and agreeable evening, the party broke up at
an hour rather late for weary wayfarers.
But the gentlemen expressed themselves free
from fatigue; and Kate, who was really a good
equestrian, so enjoyed the society of Mrs.
Rainsfield, and had become so attached to
Eleanor, that the moments seemed to fly by
with an almost incredible velocity. Not till
Mr. Rainsfield had more than once reminded
his wife that it was approaching midnight,
did the ladies take the hint to separate. Then
the matron followed by the two girls, with
their arms encircling each others waists, made
their exit; while Tom's eyes followed them
with looks of admiration.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>In the morning they all assembled at the
table; and without tiring the reader with
the conversation that was carried on, or the
entire detail of their plans, which were discussed
over the morning meal, we will give a
synopsis of the whole in a few words. It
was arranged that William, his sister, and
Mr. Wigton, accompanied by Tom and Mrs.
Rainsfield, should ride over to Fern Vale.
William and Mr. Wigton were to remain there
with John, while the rest of the party returned
to Strawberry Hill. Mr. Wigton had declined
the invitation of the Rainsfields to
remain with them for a short time on the
ground that he would not have long to remain
in their quarter, and he wished to devote as
much as possible of his time to his young
friends. Kate was to fulfil her promised visit
until her brother's house was ready for her
reception.</p>

<p>The arrangements for the passage over to
Fern Vale pleased all parties but Kate, who
had been industriously persevering to induce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
Eleanor to accompany them. But her friend
had excused herself on the plea that she very
rarely rode, was not at all a good horsewoman,
and almost invariably felt ill after a ride. So
Kate, finding entreaty useless, was constrained
to do without the companionship of her
friend. The party took their departure early
in the forenoon, without seeing Mr. Rainsfield;
who, they understood, was engaged with some
person, Mr. Billing had sent word to say, had
been waiting to see him.</p>

</div>

<p>When the black boy, whom John Ferguson
had named Billy, was released by his captors,
after the castigation we have seen him subjected
to by Rainsfield and Smithers, he made
the best of his way to Fern Vale; and there,
with his bleeding back substantiating his
statement, told his tale of woe. John and
his friend Tom Rainsfield could hardly credit
their sight; the latter especially, who could
not think but that if his brother had any
hand in the barbarity it must have been as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
passive instrument at the disposal of Smithers.
The young men felt for the poor aboriginal,
and in their sympathy tended his wounds and
gave him what assistance they could. With
the black the injury sank deep into his heart;
savage as he was he felt the ignominy of his
treatment; and he cherished that feeling of
deep revenge which is innate in the natures
of all God's creatures, but especially in those,
who like the savage, have never had an ethic
inculcation to restrain their passions. He
gave vent to his agony, as he lay prostrate
on his pallet, in wails of anguish and
vituperative mutterings; uttered in the unintelligibleness
of his own language.</p>

<p>After the subsiding of the first surprise and
indignation the agitation of his own thoughts
too much occupied John's mind to admit of
his being much diverted by the sorrows of
his black boy; and Tom was too much
affected by the dejectedness of his friend to
entertain any lasting concern for the sable
sufferer. As he sat ruminating on the inci<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>dents
of the day, until he fell into a reverie
almost as deep as one of those indulged in by
his companion, he roused himself by uttering
the following exordium: "Cheer up, John,
my dear fellow; don't permit yourself to feel
disappointed, for I am sure from the glimpse
Eleanor has had to-day of Smithers' real
nature she cannot entertain any respect for
him; and, as for her ridiculous persistence in
binding herself to a foolish engagement, I
have no doubt she will now see the necessity
of abandoning it."</p>

<p>"My dear Tom," replied the other, "I
cannot consent to oppose the claims of Bob
Smithers so long as Eleanor herself holds
them sacred. She admitted her engagement
to him in his and my presence, and at the
same time abstained from giving me any
direct answer to my proposal; I imagine, as
she thought, to avoid paining my feelings; so
I must not dare to hope."</p>

<p>"That's all moonshine," cried Tom, "banish
the idea of Bob Smithers from your head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
altogether. You say Eleanor gave you no
direct answer to your entreaties; I don't
profess to be a judge in such matters, but it
appears to me her hesitation was not disadvantageous
to you. If that ruffian had not
appeared I am sure you would have overcome
all her scruples. Persevere John! you know
the adage, 'faint heart never won fair lady;'
rouse yourself, and act upon it, and I will
stake my existence on the result."</p>

<p>"I cannot, Tom," replied his friend. "I
assure you, I cannot; I have a higher opinion
of Eleanor's integrity than to think she
would be influenced by my entreaties to
reject Smithers merely from our little fracas
yesterday. She distinctly informed me she
was engaged to him, and I am bound in
honour to respect her judgment. If I ever
had reason to believe her determination would
alter I might hope; but no, I see no prospect."</p>

<p>"You are too nice," exclaimed Tom, "upon
the point of honour, as you call it. Her
engagement I look upon as a mere phantasy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
which she will be convinced of ere long. All
you have to consider is, whether or not she
will accept you. You have had no answer
from her you say; then take an early opportunity
of seeing her, and pressing for a reply.
If you will not plead for yourself I will for
you; and shall point out to her the absurdity
and absolute sinfulness of discarding you
for that object of conceited inanition, Bob
Smithers."</p>

<p>"Much as I would desire the reversion of
the decree that forbids me hope that Eleanor
will be mine," replied John, "I would much
rather that you did not agitate her by adverting
to the subject in her hearing, as it cannot
fail to renew unpleasant reminiscences."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps it would be better," said
Tom, "to let it remain as it is for a short
time; and if you promise me to keep up
your spirits, and hope for a better state of
things, I will engage not to disturb her unnecessarily.
Why, I'll stake anything you
like on it, she is thinking of you at this very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
moment; and will no more marry Bob Smithers
than I will the ghostly Meg Merillies."</p>

<p>With a sickly smile from the forlorn lover
the conversation ceased for the time; and the
friends shortly afterwards retired to seek the
rest they respectively stood in need of. On
the following morning Tom returned to
Strawberry Hill; while John, upon busying
himself on the station, learnt that the black
boy Billy had disappeared in the night; and
that Jemmy, his companion, professed to know
nothing about him. Calling in the aid of
Joey he was enabled to trace the track of the
fugitive to the river; from which circumstance
he conjectured that Billy had waited
for the dawn of morning; when he had
taken his departure with the intention of
joining his tribe. Upon making this discovery
he felt considerable annoyance, as the black
had began to be useful, and would in all
probability be followed by his companion.
He could not help feeling disgusted at the
treatment the poor fellow had received; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
so far as he was personally concerned, he felt
himself justified in resenting the conduct of
his neighbour; which he determined to take
the earliest opportunity of stigmatizing, and
condemning in the strongest possible terms.
As he had anticipated, the other black soon
followed his fellow, and he was consequently
put to considerable inconvenience by the
deprivation of their labour.</p>

<p>Nearly a week had elapsed after this, and
Tom Rainsfield had ridden over to Fern Vale
to spend a little spare time with his friend,
and cheer him in his solitude. "My brother,"
said he, "has been again annoyed by the
blacks. They have paid him another visit,
and seem determined to cultivate his acquaintance
more closely than hitherto. I expect
that fellow of yours has given his relatives a
feeling account of his reception at our place,
and also as to the exact position of the store.
In their late visit, they were in considerable
numbers (I presume to protect themselves
against a general flogging), and they have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
vented their displeasure in a manner most
conducive to their happiness, by appropriating
what of our stores they could conveniently
remove. I believe my brother meditates
some desperate onslaught; for he is swearing
to exterminate the whole tribe if they continue
their depredations much longer."</p>

<p>"I think," replied John Ferguson, "that he
is suicidal to his own interests by perpetuating
his quarrel with the blacks. An unceasing
warfare with them will only be
conducive of misfortune, loss, and uneasiness
to both himself and his neighbours; for the
blacks will not have the sense to discriminate
between those that are friendly disposed towards
them, and those that are the reverse.
All whites to them will be the same, and will
become objects of their hatred."</p>

<p>"I agree with you to a certain extent,"
replied Tom; "and I believe the aborigines
can not only be conciliated, but be made
certainly useful, if not industrious. I don't
like the idea of driving the poor wretches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
away from the country: at the same time
you must admit our property must not be
despoiled without an effort on our part
to protect it."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied John; "but I believe
the very violation of which you speak is
merely the result of the harsh treatment
persevered in by your brother. Their visits
to you are only their retribution for injuries
received at his hands. You see they respect
my property, simply because I treat them with
some degree of lenity; at the same time I
give them to understand that I would not
permit any appropriation on their part; and
I have no doubt if your brother would adopt
the same course he would experience a
similar result."</p>

<p>"Very likely," said Tom; "but he does not
seem to think so, and I imagine it would be
hard to convince him. The hostility which
he now experiences from the blacks, I believe,
as you say, is the result of his austerity; but
he imagines it arises from their own natural<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
predilection for stealing, while his severity is
his only safeguard. I am quite of opinion
that the blackguards are naturally disposed to
pilfer; but at the same time I have no doubt
our property could be preserved by the
exercise of a moral firmness, without any of
that unnecessary harshness and cruelty which
my brother displays. But see, here they are,
paying you a visit apparently, and in open
day too; see now, if they don't upset your
theory."</p>

<p>The appearance that caused this expression
of Tom's was of a party of blacks who were
approaching the station in a slow though by
no means silent manner; for, in fact, the incessant
din of their jabber heralded them
before they were actually visible. The party
consisted of about thirty men, who were
armed with their usual weapons of spears,
boomerangs and waddies; and clad in nature's
own habiliments. They were headed by two
fellows of commanding stature and appearance;
though little differing from the others,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
except that one wore a necklace of small
bones; and the other, suspended from his
neck by a cord and resting on his breast, a
small brass-plate of a crescent shape, on which
his name was engraved. This individual,
who was the chief of the tribe, was named
Dugingi; while his companion enjoyed the
more euphonious sobriquet of Jemmy Davis.
The latter had undertaken to introduce himself
and his friend to the whites with much
form; and during the ceremony we will take
the opportunity of giving the reader a slight
outline of his and his comrade's history.</p>

<p>Dugingi was a semi-civilized black of about
the middle age, powerfully made, and decidedly
unprepossessing in his appearance. He
had been at one time a trooper in the native
police force of the colony; in which corps he
had been discreet enough to acquire all the
vices and depravities of the whites, while
their virtues remained to him that arcana of
life which held out no allurements for emulation.
When this effective force was greatly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
reduced, and in some parts entirely disbanded,
by the sapient government of the time,
Dugingi, with numerous others of his countrymen
similarly instructed, were let loose to join
their tribes, to contaminate the hitherto inoffensive
blacks with their vile inoculations.
We will not stop to review the evils that have
arisen from the system of imbuing the natures
of the blacks with a taste for sin, acquired in
scenes of crime and iniquity, and then sending
them back to their former haunts to
spread amongst their fraternity the virus of
civilized corruption. Such itself might be
made the subject of especial exposition, and
would require more space than we in this
tome can afford it.</p>

<p>Upon his juncture with his tribe the effects
of Dugingi's education soon displayed themselves;
and having been caught and convicted
of theft, and after a series of successful depredatory
exploits, he was sentenced to two years'
penal servitude at the convict establishment
in Cockatoo Island. Here, again, is another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
instance of the judicial short-sighted policy
against which we might declaim: for, setting
aside the absence of punishment to a black,
where confinement is accompanied with ease
and regular dietary; to which he has not
hitherto been accustomed (to say nothing of
his incapacity to understand the nature of his
crime, or the cause of his incarceration); the
contamination he receives during his sojourn
in those fearful sinks of infamy, complete
his immoral training; and when he again
<a name="breathes" id="breathes"></a><ins title="original had reathes">breathes</ins> the fresh air of freedom, he is as
accomplished a villain as ever graced the bar
of the Old Bailey. So it was with Dugingi.
Cockatoo Island finished what the native
police commenced; and but for his arrant
cowardice, and the dread of the settler's fire-arms,
he would have been as great a ruffian as
ever traversed the bush. But though he was
at heart a thorough scoundrel, and pretty
generally known to be so, he was kept in
check by a wholesome dread, not of the visitation
of the law (which, in the remote parts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
never could be sufficiently powerful to protect
the settlers from the depredations or
assaults of the blacks), but of a retribution
from the whites; which they took it upon
themselves to inflict, when they conceived it
necessary. Thus, though Dugingi was peaceable,
it was only the quiet of the subdued
tiger, which merely required time and opportunity
to develope its real nature. The plate,
which he wore round his neck, was given to
him upon the disbandment of the force; and
on the strength of it and his civilized acquirements,
he arrogated to himself the chiefship
of his tribe; thus proving, that in his case at
least, "knowledge was power."</p>

<p>Jemmy Davis, on the other hand, was a
very different character. He had been taken
from his tribe, when young, by a settler,
who called him after himself, and kept him
almost constantly about his person and premises.
He taught him reading and writing,
both of which Jemmy acquired admirably;
and he spoke English as fluently, and even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
more so, than many Englishmen. Some years
after his domestication, and some little time
before the date of our narrative, Mr. Davis
visited England, and took with him his
Australian namesake; keeping him constantly
by his side during the whole of a tour through
the greater part of Europe. The effects of
this would be imagined to have been the
entire eradication of his aboriginal nature,
and a perfect conversion to civilisation. So
thought his master, but he was deceived; and
so have been all those who have attempted to
naturalize the blacks to an industrial mode of
life. Jemmy Davis, as soon as he returned
with his master to Australia and the station,
took his departure from the comforts of the
whites; denuding himself of his clothes, which
he had so long accustomed himself to wear;
and joined his tribe in the state we have seen
him.</p>

<p>The case of Jemmy Davis is by no means
a singular one in the aborigines of Australia.
The attempt has frequently been made to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
induce them to assimilate their ways to those
of the whites, but, with very rare exceptions,
with the same result; nor, when we analyze
the feelings that actuate their return to savage
life, need we feel surprised. The endearments
of home, wretched as that home may be; the
ties of kindred; the love of country; the
force of early training, and old associations;
all imbue the breast of the savage in an equal
degree that similar sentiments do the bosoms
of his civilized neighbours.</p>

<p>Let a man of humble birth, and parentage
so mean that they have been considered, by
their fellow mortals, as cumberances on the
earth; we say, let him, through his own
industry and fortuitous circumstances, raise
himself to a post of eminence and power; and
amidst all the engrossing excitement of his life
of pomp and pedantry, the promptings of his
natural affection will cause his heart to yearn
after the authors of his being, and the humble
tenement that sheltered his infant head. If,
then, such feelings exist in the mind of a man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
subject to all the caprices of the world, and
made callous to the feelings of humanity by
the usages of that society that would hold up
to scorn and ridicule the exhibition of affection
for anything so mean; how much more
would the child of nature, unencumbered with
such conventionalities, and unfettered by the
prejudices of civilized life, yearn after the ties
of kindred and the associations of his early
training. Hence all attempts to draw the
savage races into a settled civilisation, and
wean them from their inherent customs, have
signally failed. Blacks may have been partially
induced to adopt the customs of the
whites, in individual cases, such as Jemmy
Davis; but their continuance is not to be
depended upon, for they soon tire of their
new life when they find that labour is its
natural adjunct, and they relapse into their
former state, preferring the indolence it ensures.</p>

<p>The mode of living of the blacks in their
wild state is primitive in the extreme; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
the sources of their sustenance equally precarious.
Their diet consists of roots, berries,
fish, small animals, and reptiles (such as
snakes and lizards); and as the country never
abounds with either, they are necessarily often
perfectly destitute; and the water as frequently
failing, coupled with the entire
absence of any degree of pre-thought or
providence on their part, and their imperfect
means of procuration, they are almost constantly
in an abject state of wretchedness.
Their weapons are primitive, singular, and
even, as savage specimens, ineffective. Their
natural characteristics are cowardice, indolence,
deceit, cunning, and treachery (particularly
to and amongst themselves); prevented
only, as we have already said, in their intercourse
with the whites, from exercising the
latter by the predominance of the first. Their
physical formation is decidedly of the inferior
order; with very few exceptions, they are by
no means muscular or well formed. Their
bodies are covered with long, raised wales,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
which are caused by incisions made with
<a name="a" id="a"></a><ins title="original had duplicate a">a</ins> sharp instrument (such as a shell or a flint),
when the patient is young; the wounds are
for some time kept open with earth, and made
to assume their embossment in the operation
of healing. In their movements they are
sluggish, though agile when stimulated to
action. Their limbs are of surprising tenuity.
In their communications with one another
they are volatile; verbose in conversation,
and puerile in manner: continually embroiled
in some quarrel, which either ends in words,
or terminates in the act of the secret assassin;
rarely coming to an open rupture while the
adversaries are on their guard.</p>

<p>Their women, or "gins," are even inferior
to the men, both physically and mentally. In
appearance they are perfectly hideous, almost
to deformity, and are the drudges of their
lords; whom they repay for their contumely,
by keeping in continual broils, during which
their feminine voices are ever heard over the
din of their verbal contentions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>We have said Jemmy Davis was the ambassador
of his tribe, and that he had introduced
himself and Dugingi to John Ferguson.
We will therefore, now, after our epic digression,
resume our narrative, by repeating the
conversation that followed.</p>

<p>"Well, Jemmy," said John Ferguson, "and
what may be your pleasure? to what may
we attribute the honour of your visit?"</p>

<p>"We came to tell you, sir," replied the
plenipo, "that we have a great 'corroboree'
to-night, and we want some rations."</p>

<p>"And what is your corroboree for, Jemmy?"
enquired John.</p>

<p>"It's a 'kipper corroboree,' sir," replied
Jemmy.</p>

<p>"Well," replied John, "I'll not give you a
mouthful of anything until you send back
my black boys. What made them leave me?
I treated them well; gave them plenty of
rations, and blankets on cold nights; so why
did they run away? Will you tell me?"</p>

<p>Dugingi replied, "Billy been tell'um me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
how Misser Rainsfield and Misser Smithers
been beat 'em; and bael budgery (not good)
that fellow; budgery (good) fellow you; bael
(not) you beat 'em black fellow; and black
fellow been wooller (say) you corbon budgery
(very good); but bael black fellow sit
down (stay) where white fellow beat 'em."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Dugingi," said John. "I
never beat the black boys, and if I knew it,
would never allow any one else to do so; but
because Mr. Rainsfield flogged Billy is that
any reason why he should run away from me?
Let him and the other boy come back, and I'll
give you some rations for your corroboree;
but if they don't come back, I'll not give you
anything."</p>

<p>An altercation then ensued between Dugingi
and the fugitives, who appeared to be of the
visiting party; and it was ultimately arranged
that they should return after their feast.</p>

<p>"I suppose we can come and see your corroboree,
if we like, Dugingi?" asked John.</p>

<p>"Yuoi (yes), Masser," said Dugingi, "you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
come along in three-fellow hours after sun go
down, and me be see 'um you. Misser Tom
he come along too, he budgery fellow to black
fellow; but bael budgery fellow brother belong
to him, he corbon (big) &mdash;&mdash; rogue."</p>

<p>This defamatory expression of opinion of
Dugingi's on the merits of Mr. Rainsfield was
uttered in no tone, and with no expression of
amiability; and Tom attempted to smother
his ire as he replied, "You are highly flattering,
Dugingi, not only to me but to my
brother; but, never mind, I'll go and see you.
Me be brother belonging to you; you go ask
my brother for rations like it corroboree."</p>

<p>"He been give it," replied Dugingi, "plenty
plour (flour), tea, sugar, bacca; corbon
plenty."</p>

<p>"Gammon!" exclaimed Tom, "I know better
than that."</p>

<p>"Bael gammon," replied the black; "he
been give it I tell you, plenty;" whereupon
Dugingi whispered a few words to his companions
in his own dialect, and the whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
sable conclave burst out into a loud laugh,
and commenced an almost deafening jabbering
amongst themselves. After which Dugingi
and Jemmy Davis, promising faithfully
to send the black boys over to the station
after the corroboree, got their promised provender,
and decamped.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
